# Terminology

## Backend Server

The server(s) that run the part of the internet you don't see, this is how facebook stores your user information, how youtube calculates what videos to show you next, and how WhatsApp sends your messages to other users.

## Nfts

Non Fungible Tokens are items stored on a blockchain that are not currencies in of themselves, currently they tend to take the form of images or "art" and are mainly used for monetary gain. However this technology will be very important to the development of platforms that run on "[Web 3.0](terminology.md#web-3.0)" and should grow to be used for actually useful purposes other than just "investments" in the future. (An example of a more elegant use of nfts is the ownership certification for a piece of content on the internet - a [web3.0](terminology.md#web-3.0) platform could use this certification to calculate where to send advertisement revenue generated from the content)

## Nodes

A Node is a server or computer that contributes to a network, typically through 'mining' for the blockchain which is a term used to describe validating blocks and transactions up to the schema required by the protocol of the network.

## ROI

Return on Investment, how much someone earns relative to how much it cost them to earn that amount.

## Web 3.0

This is a buzzword used to cover all types of websites/software that either are or are built upon blockchain technology, this includes things like [nfts](terminology.md#nfts), cryptocurrencies and more recently games that are built using nfts as in game items. There's a lot of argument on the internet about whether or not this is just a buzzword meant to hype people up and get them to buy cryptocurrencies/[nfts](terminology.md#nfts) so as to benefit other "investors".
