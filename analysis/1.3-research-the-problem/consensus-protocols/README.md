# Consensus Protocols

### What is a Consensus Protocol?

A consensus protocol is the protocol that a blockchain system uses to validate blocks created by nodes during the block creation stage. This is needed because in a decentralised system, the nodes (aka computers) that run the system cannot necessarily be trusted, as one node may wish to do something that benefits themselves such as paying themselves currency that doesn't actually exist. This type of node is typically referred to as a bad actor

### Proof of Work

Proof of work is the most common consensus protocol and was originally introduced by the bitcoin blockchain, it is quite simple and secure which is what made it a good choice for the first cryptocurrency, however it does also have some serious issues.

It works by requiring the hash of a block that is added to the blockchain to be below a target value based upon how long it took the past&#x20;
