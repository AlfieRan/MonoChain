### Overview

Bitcoin was created in 2008 and was the first cryptocurrency to be created digitally, it has also gone on to become the most valuable cryptocurrency per coin, being valued at £24,082.50 GBP per coin as of the 18th of May 2022, being over 10 times the value of the next most valuable per coin cryptocurrency, Eth on the Ethereum blockchain (which I have also researched below) of which is valued at £1,638.47 GBP. Although it is worth mentioning that there are approximately 120 million Eth in circulation at the point of writing, compared to Bitcoin's 18 million, which closes the total valuation gap considerably.

## Ethereum



### Overview

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency as of time of writing (Friday 20th May 2022), costing approximately £1,650 GBP per coin. It was launched on the 30th of July 2015 and has grown to a current market cap of £195,873,606,031.48 (\~£200 Bn) in the just under 7 years it has been in use.

### [Consensus Protocol](consensus-protocols/#what-is-a-consensus-protocol)

Ethereum began as a [proof of power](consensus-protocols/#proof-of-power) blockchain but due to the environmental issues it has begun switching to a [proof of stake](consensus-protocols/#proof-of-stake) blockchain and intends to merge the current developer network that runs the proof of stake version of ethereum with the main network that uses proof of power sometime in August this year (2022) although that date has already been postponed over a year so it may be completed at a later date. Because Ethereum is currently undergoing a transition to proof of stake and by the time you are reading this is should have been completed I will be referring to Ethereum's consensus protocol as proof of stake for the remainder of this project.
