# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Fundamentals

### Chaining Blocks

The blocks will need to be chained together in such a way that if a single one of them is edited, all blocks which connect to it prove that it has been mutated and the edited block was not the original block of which they connected to. To do this, the blocks will contain an id field, this id will be the hash of the previous block's and they will also include a parent\_id field, this is the id of that previous block.

This means that the parent\_id can be used to find the parent block of which a child block is chained, then by hashing the parent block and comparing it to the child block's id it can be validated that the pairing has not been tampered with - or if the hash does not equal the child block's id then the pairing has been tampered with and the chain has been invalidated.

The blocks should also contain the number block that they think they are, as this makes validation and navigation easier for nodes, as if a different node supplies them with block 347 in response to a request when the node thinks that there's only 43 blocks in existence then they need to either confirm the larger quantity of blocks or disregard the other node as untrustworthy.

### Referencing Owned Data

whenever something happens to a piece of data that requires proof of ownership by a user, such as sending it to someone else, the node calculating whether or not this is valid must travel down the blockchain until it finds enough of that data being sent to the user as the user is attempting to send to someone else. This is to stop users trying to duplicate data because it shows the user actually has the data/items they want to transfer currently in their wallet, but it could result in a node travelling throughout the entire blockchain if a user tries to send an item that they don't own.

## Creating Data

### Required Fields

Whenever new data, whether it be coins, a certificate of ownership, or anything else is created, it is essential that it contains a field that states who created it. This allows anything to be added to the blockchain as if it was a giant public database, but prevents someone from being able to claim they own something that they don't.

An example of this is the main currency of this system, the mono, a mono will only be valid and acceptable if its creation flag is attributed to the system. This means that the mono must be created by the system itself, and because typically a creation will be attributed using the creator's public key/id this can only happen when a new block is generated, and such monos should only be accepted as true and valid if when they were created by the system the amount of them created in a single block is below the limit set. How this limit is calculated in the below section.

### How many of each data type can be generated.

This limit of how many of a data object can be created both per block and in total can be dictated through either a constant value, a function dictated in the protocol, or algorithmically by an algorithm stored in the origin block.&#x20;

Each version has it's own benefits and drawbacks:

Due to the above specifications, I will be aiming to add support for algorithms defined in blocks, an initialise the algorithms for base commodities within the origin block, however during initial development cycles the limits will just be defined as constants as it is much quicker to setup and test with.

This choice also allows for the blockchain to progress into the future without an individual to control it through the process of voting, which is something the final product would ideally contain, however since that is a feature that requires a lot of pre-requisites I will only be adding it to the project if there is time, although it will probably be theorised in [chapter 2.5, "The Protocol"](../2.5-the-protocol/2.5.3-consensus-algorithm/2.5.3.5-voting.md).

## Storing Data

### State Root

This is a concept that has been inspired by Ethereum's feature of the same name and allows the state of all wallets and stores in the blockchain to be tracked simply using a hash of the current state of the entire system in each block. The idea here is that nodes should hold the latest copy of all the contents of every user's wallets, and that a hash of this state root should be stored in every new block such that when a node connects to the network they can get collect the state root from a different node, verify it to the latest block's state root hash and if it is valid, then continue computing from there.

This massively lowers the amount of computations a node has to do per transaction validation, because without this nodes would have to travel back throughout the entire blockchain looking for proof of ownership of an item that is to be transacted.

[(Ethereum, 2015)](../reference-list.md)

### Storing Blocks

The more blocks a node stores, the better. However they do not need to store them all, as long as nodes know multiple other nodes who store a copy of each block there isn't any major downside to a node only storing a portion of the total blocks in the blockchain.

Yet there is a catch to this, if all nodes begin to only store the most recent blocks then the current existence of the blockchain and all user's wallet contents will be fine and continue as normal but the transaction history for the blockchain will be erased.

This could be looked at as a benefit of the system because it technically increases anonymity whilst retaining function, but in certain cases it could be an issue. The reason this is an accepted risk is because the storage gains and general computational benefits are great enough as a network like this scales and this risk is low enough that it is a worthy risk to take.&#x20;

## Limitations

### Performance

Although I would like to make it so that any person with a spare computer could help compute towards this blockchain as a node and receive as much of a reward as someone with a top of the line server, due to the nature of this project being computationally complex, the more powerful a computer is, the more useful it is to the system.

This is because nodes need to not only do thousands of checks, data requests, node-to-node communications and general computations per block validation, but they need to be able to do so fast enough to be a part of the validation of a block that makes it on to the blockchain in order to actually receive a reward.

Therefore the blockchain system itself will be limited by the capabilities of its nodes and the nodes will be limited by the relative performance of themselves to the other nodes on the network.
