# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Fundamentals

### Chaining Blocks

The blocks will need to be chained together in such a way that if a single one of them is edited, all blocks which connect to it prove that it has been mutated and the edited block was not the original block of which they connected to. To do this, the blocks will contain an id field, this id will be the hash of the previous block's and they will also include a parent\_id field, this is the id of that previous block.

### Creating new data

Whenever new data, whether it be coins, a certificate of ownership, or anything else is created, it is essential that it contains a field that states who created it. This allows anything to be added to the blockchain as if it was a giant public database, but prevents someone from being able to claim they own something that they don't.

An example of this is the main currency of this system, the mono, a mono will only be valid and acceptable if its creation flag is attributed to the system. This means that the mono must be created by the system itself, and because typically a creation will be attributed using the creator's public key/id this can only happen when a new block is generated, and such monos should only be accepted as true and valid if when they were created by the system the amount of them created in a single block is below the&#x20;
