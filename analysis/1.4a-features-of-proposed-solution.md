# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Fundamentals

### Chaining Blocks

The blocks will need to be chained together in such a way that if a single one of them is edited, all blocks which connect to it prove that it has been mutated and the edited block was not the original block of which they connected to. To do this, the blocks will contain an id field, this id will be the hash of the previous block's and they will also include a parent\_id field, this is the id of that previous block.

The blocks should also contain the number of the block that they think they are, as this makes navigation for nodes easier.

### Referencing Owned Data

whenever something happens to a piece of data that requires proof of ownership by a user, such as sending it to someone else, the node calculating whether or not this is valid must travel down the blockchain until it finds enough of that data being sent to the user as the user is attempting to send to someone else. This is to stop users trying to duplicate data because it shows the user actually has the data/items they want to transfer currently in their wallet, but it could result in a node travelling throughout the entire blockchain if a user tries to send an item they don't own.

## Creating Data

### Required Fields

Whenever new data, whether it be coins, a certificate of ownership, or anything else is created, it is essential that it contains a field that states who created it. This allows anything to be added to the blockchain as if it was a giant public database, but prevents someone from being able to claim they own something that they don't.

An example of this is the main currency of this system, the mono, a mono will only be valid and acceptable if its creation flag is attributed to the system. This means that the mono must be created by the system itself, and because typically a creation will be attributed using the creator's public key/id this can only happen when a new block is generated, and such monos should only be accepted as true and valid if when they were created by the system the amount of them created in a single block is below the limit set. This limit is calculated in the below section.

### How many of each data type can be generated.

This limit of how many of a data object can be created both per block and in total can be dictated through either a constant value, a function dictated in the protocol, or algorithmically by an algorithm stored in the origin block.&#x20;

Each version has it's own benefits and drawbacks:

|          | Due to not being set in the protocol nodes verifying this data must go and fetch the algorithm. |
|          | More Complicated to implement                                                                   |
|          | If algorithm is not written correctly, it could cause massive issues for users later on.        |
