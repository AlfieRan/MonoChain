# Phase 1

Phase 1 will be a very basic version of the final blockchain, featuring a centralised node basis, something that will obviously be changed in a future phase, such that basic JSON transactions can be made by a user by sending a request to a set, centralised node.

Features required to run phase 1:

* A Transaction schema, which represents how transactions will be formed.
* A Blockchain Schema, which represents A block schema and a method for chaining the blocks together.
* A temporary node script to receive transactions from a client and apply them to the blockchain.
