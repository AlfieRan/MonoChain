# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why Blockchain Technology?

Technology is centralising industries through monopolies and oligopolies [(Hall, 2021)](../reference-list.md) at an alarming rate, destroying healthy competition and removing innovation in exchange for the few companies in charge's profit lines. Yet in recent years crypto currencies and other decentralised technologies have risen up in a fire of publicity and investments, this has sparked a new wave of technologists sharing rumours of a new generation of the internet, a generation that is decentralised and owned by it's users rather than by a small group of powerful leaders that care more about the lining of their pockets rather than their users.

The aim of this project is to experiment with this new blockchain technology and see if the future of web 3.0 is really as grand as it is proposed.
