# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why Blockchain Technology?

Technology is centralising industries through monopolies and oligopolies [(Hall, 2021)](../reference-list.md) at an alarming rate, destroying healthy competition and removing innovation in exchange for the few companies in charge's profit lines. Yet in recent years crypto currencies and other decentralised technologies have risen up in a fire of publicity and investments, sparking a new wave of technologists sharing rumours of a new generation of the internet, a generation that is decentralised and owned by it's users rather than by a small group of powerful leaders that care more about the lining of their pockets rather than their users.

Although technology is definitely not the only culprit of this growing wealth (and therefore power) inequality, as ever since the dollar became a fiat currency in 1971 - Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. - &#x20;

> A monetary system dominated by central banks and use of traditional fiat money has shown to benefit certain people more than others, such as bankers and moneylenders [(Thornton, 2015)](../reference-list.md). The traditional fiat money system is an inflationary system with a tendency to hurt the workforce and savers, resulting in hurting the lower and middle classes. It is designed to enrich those who control and operate the financial industry and the upper class [(Thornton, 2015](../reference-list.md)).

That is where blockchain technology comes in, allowing data to be stored on a decentralised series of nodes (user's computers) so as to give people control over their own data rather than the oligopolies, and because of how this data is signed by the sender and we can track such data through the entire chain, this also allows the construction of cryptographically verified data and proof of ownership.&#x20;

However, current Blockchains don't tend to have much support for actual useful things and either only have support for the currencies they were built alongside - Such as the bitcoin blockchain which only has support for bitcoin _- <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>_ or very small amounts of metadata. Such as the Ethereum blockchain, which relies upon all nodes that store the blockchain storing all of the data in it, or having connections to other nodes with all of the data, massively limiting what can be stored - right now this is about 0.5-1TB of data.
