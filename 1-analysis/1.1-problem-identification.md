# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why Blockchain Technology?

Technology is centralising industries through monopolies and oligopolies [(Hall, 2021)](../reference-list.md) at an alarming rate, destroying healthy competition and removing innovation in exchange for the few companies in charge's profit lines. Yet in recent years crypto currencies and other decentralised technologies have risen up in a fire of publicity and investments, sparking a new wave of technologists sharing rumours of a new generation of the internet, a generation that is decentralised and owned by it's users rather than by a small group of powerful leaders that care more about the lining of their pockets rather than their users.

Although technology is definitely not the only culprit of this growing wealth (and therefore power) inequality, as ever since the dollar became a fiat currency in 1971 it's value has continued to diminish. Which paired with inflation being higher than that of interest rates means that the average working or middle class citizen who chooses to save their money in a bank is actually loosing money over time, rather than gaining it, and the real way that the corporate elite increase their spare funds over time is through the use of (NOT FINISHED)

> A monetary system dominated by central banks and use of traditional fiat money has shown to benefit certain people more than others, such as bankers and moneylenders [(Thornton, 2015)](../reference-list.md). The traditional fiat money system is an inflationary system with a tendency to hurt the workforce and savers, resulting in hurting the lower and middle classes. It is designed to enrich those who control and operate the financial industry and the upper class [(Thornton, 2015](../reference-list.md)).

That is where blockchain technology comes in, allowing data to be stored on a decentralised series of nodes (user's computers) so as to give people control over their own data rather than the oligopolies, and because of how this data is signed by the sender and we can track such data through the entire chain, this also allows the construction of cryptographically verified data and proof of ownership.&#x20;

However, current Blockchains don't tend to have much support for actual useful things and either only have support for the currencies they were built alongside - Such as the bitcoin blockchain which only has support for bitcoin _- <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>_ or very small amounts of metadata. Such as the Ethereum blockchain, which relies upon all nodes that store the blockchain storing all of the data in it, or having connections to other nodes with all of the data, massively limiting what can be stored - right now this is about 0.5-1TB of data. [(Anon, 2022)](../reference-list.md).

This is where this project comes in, as instead of the methods of data storage mentioned above, the "monochain" will be based upon using JSON data that can effectively store any form of data needed (by putting raw binary in a string, converting other data objects into JSON format, etc) and does not need every node to store every piece of data, instead nodes just need to be aware of enough other nodes that store all the other data, such that any individual node can always get any piece of data it needs. This will mean that initially, nodes will need to store all the data on the network as there won't be enough of them to only store a portion each, however if the network was to scale to one of a fraction of the size of something like bitcoin or ethereum's network then this segmented data storage method would take maximum effect.
