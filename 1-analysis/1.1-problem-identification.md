## Why Blockchain Technology?

Technology is centralising industries through monopolies and oligopolies [(Hall, 2021)](../reference-list.md) at an alarming rate, destroying healthy competition and removing innovation in exchange for the few companies in charge's profit lines. Yet in recent years crypto currencies and other decentralised technologies have risen up in a fire of publicity and investments, sparking a new wave of technologists sharing rumours of a new generation of the internet, a generation that is decentralised and owned by it's users rather than by a small group of powerful leaders that care more about the lining of their pockets rather than their users.

That is where blockchain technology comes in

Current Blockchains don't have much support for actual useful things and either only have support for the currencies they were built alongside. Such as the bitcoin blockchain which only has support for bitcoin, and others that do have support for other kinds of data, such as the Ethereum blockchain, rely upon all nodes that store the blockchain storing all of the data in it, or connections to other nodes with all of the data, which right now is about 0.5-1TB of data and means that it does not support large amounts of data [(Anon, 2022)](../reference-list.md).
