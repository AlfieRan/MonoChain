# 1.4.3 The Webportal

### Initially the webportal will contain a few primary sections:

* A Homepage to explain the project.
* A 'Learn More' page to explain some of the more technical side of the project in more detail
* And some form of link to the source code as well as any other relevant external documents.

### Then as the project progresses and reaches a point at which transactions can be completed it should gain:

* A Wallet page which allows users to generate or load their wallets to see the contents and what they are storing.
* A Marketplace which allows the purchase and sale of data, currency and other blockchain items to other users on the network.

In this case the primary sections will be developed early on in the projects development and are essential, with the secondary sections being important but not being truly essential to the project's use.
