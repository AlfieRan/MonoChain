# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## The Blockchain

### Transactions and Digital Signatures

Transactions on this blockchain will abide by a few rules, rules which form the system that allow for digital signatures to take place and therefore transactions on the whole.

These rules are the following:

* Wallets (and therefore users) are identified by their public keys
* The transactions themselves are encrypted using a wallet's private key and can be decrypted using that wallet's public key. This is effectively the opposite of standard encryption, as anyone can read this data, because only the owner can write a transaction involving themselves, however with typical encryption, anyone can write a message but only the owner can read them.
* Transactions should include a timestamp of when they were approved, if the transaction is included on a block that is timestamped to outside of a set time frame of the transaction's time stamp then the transaction should be counted as null and void.
* Transactions should then also obviously include where the coins/proof of ownership should be sent to, and what is being sent.

Following these rules gives us an idea of what each transaction should look like:

| Sender's public key | Transaction                | Recipient's public key | Timestamp                    | Sender Encrypted Copy |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| b94d27b9            | {type: coin, quantity: 50} | j45n63m3               | Thu Mar 17 2022 19:06:50 GMT | 821a643d5ebf18ee9     |

In JSON format that would look something like the following:

```
{
    Sender-Key: "b94d27b9",
    Transaction:
        [{type: coin, quantity: 50}],
    Recipient-Key: "j45n63m3",
    Timestamp: "Thu Mar 17 2022 19:06:50 GMT",
    Sender-Encrypted: "821a643d5ebf18ee9"
}    
```

It's important to mention that the Sender-Encrypted hash of the data does not include itself, otherwise that would create a recursion error and would be impossible to destruct. Instead the Sender-Encrypted hash is a hash of everything except itself in a separate JSON object than the one in the blockchain.

Therefore, in this scenario the sender would be hashing and encrypting the following:

```
{
    Sender-Key: "b94d27b9",
    Transaction:
        [{type: coin, quantity: 50}],
    Recipient-Key: "j45n63m3",
    Timestamp: "Thu Mar 17 2022 19:06:50 GMT",
}
```

This is very important to bear in mind when writing the node mining software as if the whole json transaction is validated it will never validate successfully, and instead the section of the transaction referenced above is the part that should be validated according to the Sender-encrypted hash.
