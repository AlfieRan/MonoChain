# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## The Blockchain

### Signing transactions

Transactions on this blockchain will abide by a few rules, rules which form the system that allow for digital signatures to take place and therefore transactions on the whole.

These rules are the following:

* Wallets (and therefore users) are identified by their public keys
* The transactions themselves are encrypted using a wallet's private key and can be decrypted using that wallet's public key. This is effectively the opposite of standard encryption, as anyone can read this data, because only the owner can write a transaction involving themselves, however with typical encryption, anyone can write a message but only the owner can read them.&#x20;
* Transactions should include a timestamp of when they were approved, if the transaction is included on a block that is timestamped to outside of a set time frame of the transaction's time stamp then the transaction should be counted as null and void.



## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
