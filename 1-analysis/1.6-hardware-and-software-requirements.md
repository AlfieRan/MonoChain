# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

The following are the requirements of a system in order to develop for the blockchain system described in these documents.&#x20;

| Software used | Reason for Use                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yarn          | A package manager used to install and run the necessary packages used by this repository.                                                                        |
| Node.js       | A javascript interpreter used to actually run the software.                                                                                                      |
| Google Chrome | A web browser is needed to test the webportal and ensure that users can actually do everything they need. (Access their wallet, download the node software, etc) |
| Webstorm      | A programming environment used to write the code, acts as a text editor as well as having a terminal component for developing, building and packaging the code.  |

The below guidelines are based upon all the tools specified in the software used above and&#x20;

| Hardware     | Minimum Hardware Requirement | Recommended                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU          | 4 vCPUs                      | 4 Cores                                          |
| Memory (RAM) | 2GB                          | 8GB                                              |
| Storage      | 25GB                         | 25GB                                             |
| OS           | Windows 7+ (64 bit)          | Latest 64 Bit Version of Windows, macOS or Linux |

## User Requirements

The typical user will only need a web browser in order to use the network, that is because in order to view their wallet, make transactions and use the blockchain they will need access to the website accompanying this project [(https://monochain.network)](https://monochain.network).

However, users who intend to use their computing power as a node for the network will need to be able to run the node software created as part of this project. The final version of this software will be written in V [(V lang)](https://vlang.io/), which gets compiled down to C and then machine code.
