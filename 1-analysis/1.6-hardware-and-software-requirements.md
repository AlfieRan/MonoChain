The following are the requirements of a system in order to develop for the blockchain system described in these documents.&#x20;

| Software used | Reason for Use                                                                                                                                                      |

| Google Chrome | A web browser is needed to test the webportal and ensure that users can actually do everything they need to. (Access their wallet, download the node software, etc) |
| Webstorm      | A programming environment used to write the code, acts as a text editor aswell as having a terminal component for developing, building and packaging the code.      |
