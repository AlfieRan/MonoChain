### Individual blocks

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                | Reference                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | This prevents any user from being able to insert a block in-between two pre-existing blocks and is what forms the "chain" itself.                                                                            | [The Blocks](1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution.md#chaining-blocks)                                   |
| 2        | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | If the node software cannot tell when a block is invalid, the whole system is effectively useless as if a bad actor manages to bypass the initial validation they could successfully hijack the whole system | [The blockchain](1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution.md#referencing-owned-data)                        |
| 3        | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software           | If the node software mistakenly disproves of valid blocks they could punish good nodes/users, discouraging them from continued use of the system.                                                            | [Keeping Block Creation  Secure](1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution.md#keeping-block-creation-secure) |

### Network Communication

| Ref No. | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                               | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4       | Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.                                                | This is what allows nodes to communicate, which results in how the computations will be shared and how blocks will be updated to nodes around the blockchain                                                                                                                                       |
| 5       | Node should have web-socket connection abilities for server or client connections.                                                                                                      | This will allow 'private' nodes who do not have a public dns/ip address to connect to the network without having to set up a public address like is needed for a http server.                                                                                                                      |
| 6       | Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally                                                                           | This prevents a node from having to rebuild it's network every time it connects to the network, and instead just connect to the nodes it already knows                                                                                                                                             |
| 7       | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. | This allows Node to remember who they've found trustworthy and who they shouldn't trust again so they can send things that require higher security (such as transaction initialisations) to more trustworthy nodes.                                                                                |
| 8       | Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.                                                                                                                  | This ensures that each node knows who they're talking to and ensures that they don't hold a grudge against the wrong wallet.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9       | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains                                                                         | This is so that when a node wants to communicate with a node running under a specific wallet they can communicate with the ips and domains they have associated with that node in the past instead of having to ask around other nodes until they find an active communicator to that wallet/node. |

### General features

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                  | Reason                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10       | A configuration handler                                    | This allows for the loading and saving of node settings so that the node doesn't have to be setup up every time it launches. |
| 11       | Nodes should have some kind of web based access dashboard. | This allows the user to see what their node is currently doing and interact with it directly.                                |

## Webportal

### Page types

| Ref. No. | Page                                                                                              | Justifcation                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12       | A "home" page that summarises what the project is about.                                          | Gives users a quick and brief explanation of what the project is so they can decide whether or not they want to continue using it.                                                                       |
| 13       | An "info" page that explains the project in more detail.                                          | This will give users a more detailed understanding of what is actually going on in the project and how it works, whilst attempting to solve any questions that may have been generated by the home page. |
| 14       | A "downloads" page that lets the user download the node software.                                 | This is how users will get access to the node software and will help contribute to the network, thus is essential for increasing the ease of use of the project to a reasonable degree.                  |
| 15       | A "wallet" page that allows the user to see any data or items stored within their digital wallet. | This makes it much easier for casual users to see what they 'own' and thus interact with the network from a browser without having to download anything.                                                 |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 16       | Non-technical users must be able to identify what the point of the project is just from the homepage of the website. | <ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md#the-whole-internet-web-3.0">Stakeholders include typical internet users.</a></li></ul>                           | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                            |
| 17       | Users should be able to get to the majority of what they would want to get to within 3 clicks.                       | The easier it is for users to get to where they want to go, the more likely they are to do whatever they're trying to do.                             | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                            |
| 18       | The web-portal should be available and working on a variety of device sizes including mobile and desktop.            | This allows users with any kind of internet enabled device to be able to use the site, as users tend to be distributed across different device types. | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md#the-whole-internet-web-3.0) |
