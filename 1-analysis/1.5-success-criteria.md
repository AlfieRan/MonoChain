| 1        | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | This prevents any user from being able to insert a block in-between two pre-existing blocks and is what forms the "chain" itself.                                                                            | [The blockchain](../notes/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/#the-blockchain), [The individual blocks.](../notes/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/#the-blocks) |
| 2        | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | If the node software cannot tell when a block is invalid, the whole system is effectively useless as if a bad actor manages to bypass the initial validation they could successfully hijack the whole system |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3        | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software           | If the node software mistakenly disproves of valid blocks they could punish good nodes/users, discouraging them from continued use of the system.                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
