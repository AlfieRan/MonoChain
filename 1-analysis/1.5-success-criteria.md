| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | This prevents any user from being able to insert a block in-between two pre-existing blocks and is what forms the "chain" itself.                                                                            | [The blockchain](../notes/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/#the-blockchain), [The individual blocks.](../notes/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/#the-blocks) |
| 2        | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | If the node software cannot tell when a block is invalid, the whole system is effectively useless as if a bad actor manages to bypass the initial validation they could successfully hijack the whole system |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3        | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software           | If the node software mistakenly disproves of valid blocks they could punish good nodes/users, discouraging them from continued use of the system.                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Network Communication

|         | Nodes should all have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.                                            | This is what allows nodes to communicate, which results in how the computations will be shared and how blocks will be updated to nodes around the blockchain |
|         | Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally                                                                           | This prevents a node from having to rebuild it's network every time it connects to the network, and instead just connect to the nodes it already knows       |
|         | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. |                                                                                                                                                              |
|         | Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                              |
|         | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                              |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
