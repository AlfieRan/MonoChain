### Overview

Bitcoin was created in 2008 and was the first cryptocurrency to be created digitally, it has also gone on to become the most valuable cryptocurrency per coin, being valued at £24,082.50 GBP per coin as of the 18th of May 2022, being over 10 times the value of the next most valuable per coin cryptocurrency, Eth on the Ethereum blockchain (which I have also researched below) of which is valued at £1,638.47 GBP. Although it is worth mentioning that there are approximately 120 million Eth in circulation at the point of writing, compared to Bitcoin's 18 million, which closes the total valuation gap considerably.
