# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational thinking is a type of thinking used to figure out how a problem can be solved. The process of computational thinking can be summarised as formulating and thinking about a problem from such a perspective that it can be solved algorithmically and thus can be solves through the use of creating an algorithmic solution that can be reused on similar problems.

Using the five main computational methods subtitled in the sections below allows you to create an efficient and useful solution. They will be useful in my project because:

* Examples

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is a term used in computer science and computational thinking to refer to the process of removing unnecessary details from a problem in order to focus only on the core details that actually matter when creating a solution to that problem. Thinking abstractly is very important in blockchain design because each node may hold thousands of blocks in its storage and each block on a blockchain has the potential to hold thousands of transactions which may hold multiple data transfers. This means that any unnecessary data stored on the blockchain can be amplified massively in the final product.

It's also very important when designing the blockchain so as to remove a lot of the complications of an over-engineered and unnecessarily complicated development cycle and let you focus only on what actually matters so as to create a working and (hopefully) finished network.&#x20;

* The base transaction protocol, this needs to contain the main types of data transfer supported by the network, but attempting to solve for all possible types of transaction would be nearly impossible and would result in a lot of excess rules that would only be used in very very rare scenarios.
* Communication within nodes, it's important that this communication system ignores any excess bulk data that could be seen as useful but actually isn't that important. This is because as the system grows, the amount of inter-node communications increases exponentially (similar to the network effect).

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is the computational method used to consider what requirements the problem's solution will required and how the current and early stages of the solution will need to build towards those requirements. Thinking ahead is important as it allows you to figure out roughly how the blockchain should look and the key features it needs to meet the problem identified. This is then also useful for figuring out what the approximate steps should be to reach this solution.

To ensure my project is finished in time and meets all of the requirements I have set myself in the [features of proposed solution](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/) I will need to ensure that I plan how I'm going to meet all the requirements very early on, as everything in this project will be based upon a few concrete ideas that act as the foundations for the code and general protocol.&#x20;

An example of this is the consensus protocol, which is a very key point to how the blockchain functions and because the consensus protocol I have decided to use is designed by myself I have to figure out how I want the general process to work in order to implement this in the rest of the blockchain. [This can be seen in my bullet point summary of the original concept for Proof of Worth.](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution/proof-of-worth.md)

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of splitting up a major, large and complex problem into lots of minor, little and simple problems that can be procedurally solved in order to build up to solving the major, large problem.

Procedural thinking is extremely important in blockchain design as the entire system is built upon a decompositional structure (The blockchain splits up into blocks which split into transactions, etc) and in order to build a blockchain system the structure must be built procedurally in order to ensure that each structure works&#x20;



Thinking procedurally is important in game design as it allows you to think about how to write the code for the game and how you can refactor parts of it that are needed for several parts of the game design.

During the design of the game, I will need to focus on one task at a time. When these sub-tasks come together they will make my game work as intended. The tasks to focus on will be mainly outlined by my [success criteria](broken-reference). Focusing on the problems at hand, I will not lose focus on the end goal of finishing the project.

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
