# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational thinking is a type of thinking used to figure out how a problem can be solved. The process of computational thinking can be summarised as formulating and thinking about a problem from such a perspective that it can be solved algorithmically and thus can be solves through the use of creating an algorithmic solution that can be reused on similar problems.

Using the five main computational methods subtitled in the sections below allows you to create an efficient and useful solution. They will be useful in my project because:

* Simulating platforms (which are effectively floating islands) and death is not possible to simulate in real life, so a computer program is needed.
* Computational methods allow data to be saved which will need to be accessed fast at any time the player wants to continue playing
* The user needs to be able to input from the keyboard to control the events happening in the game
* The game needs to have a graphical representation so that the player can easily understand what is going on. This will also require a physics implementation to control the features of the game which are not controlled by the user.
