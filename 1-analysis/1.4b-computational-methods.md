# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational thinking is a type of thinking used to figure out how a problem can be solved. The process of computational thinking can be summarised as formulating and thinking about a problem from such a perspective that it can be solved algorithmically and thus can be solves through the use of creating an algorithmic solution that can be reused on similar problems.

Using the five main computational methods subtitled in the sections below allows you to create an efficient and useful solution. They will be useful in my project because:

* Examples

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
