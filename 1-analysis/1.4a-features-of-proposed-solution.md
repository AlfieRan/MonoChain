# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## The solution will contain three main parts.

### The Protocol

This is what describes how the blockchain will operate, how it is put together and how [nodes](../terminology.md#nodes) will operate. It is what will be described throughout the rest of this section.

### The [Node](../terminology.md#nodes) Software

This is the software that runs on a computer contributing to the network and uses the rules created in the protocol to generate, validate and view blocks and transactions within the blockchain. Since this is effectively the software form of the protocol it will not be described in this section.

### The Web-portal

This simply acts as an introduction to the project and will host some key information, a link to the documents of this project of which you are currently reading, a link to view the source code for the entire project and hopefully some other features which I will mention at the end of this section.

## The Protocol

### Chaining Blocks

The blocks will need to be chained together in such a way that if a single one of them is edited, all blocks which connect to it prove that it has been mutated and the edited block was not the original block of which they connected to. To do this, the blocks will contain an id field, this id will be the hash of the previous block's and they will also include a parent\_id field, this is the id of that previous block.

This means that the parent\_id can be used to find the parent block of which a child block is chained, then by hashing the parent block and comparing it to the child block's id it can be validated that the pairing has not been tampered with - or if the hash does not equal the child block's id then the pairing has been tampered with and the chain has been invalidated.

The blocks should also contain the number block that they think they are, as this makes validation and navigation easier for nodes, as if a different node supplies them with block 347 in response to a request when the node thinks that there's only 43 blocks in existence then they need to either confirm the larger quantity of blocks or disregard the other node as untrustworthy.

### Referencing Owned Data

whenever something happens to a piece of data that requires proof of ownership by a user, such as sending it to someone else, the node calculating whether or not this is valid must travel down the blockchain until it finds enough of that data being sent to the user as the user is attempting to send to someone else. This is to stop users trying to duplicate data because it shows the user actually has the data/items they want to transfer currently in their wallet, but it could result in a node travelling throughout the entire blockchain if a user tries to send an item that they don't own.

### Creating Data

#### Required Fields

Whenever new data, whether it be coins, a certificate of ownership, or anything else is created, it is essential that it contains a field that states who created it. This allows anything to be added to the blockchain as if it was a giant public database, but prevents someone from being able to claim they own something that they don't.

An example of this is the main currency of this system, the mono, a mono will only be valid and acceptable if its creation flag is attributed to the system. This means that the mono must be created by the system itself, and because typically a creation will be attributed using the creator's public key/id this can only happen when a new block is generated, and such monos should only be accepted as true and valid if when they were created by the system the amount of them created in a single block is below the limit set. How this limit is calculated is described in the below section.

#### How many of a piece of data can be generated.

This limit of how many of a data object can be created both per block and in total can be dictated through either a constant value, a function dictated in the protocol, or algorithmically by an algorithm stored in the origin block.&#x20;

Each version has it's own benefits and drawbacks:

[(crypto.com, 2022)](../reference-list.md)

Due to the above specifications, I will be aiming to add support for algorithms defined in blocks, and initialise the algorithms for base commodities within the origin block, however initially the limits will just be defined as constants as it is much quicker to setup and test with.

This choice also allows for the blockchain to progress into the future without an individual to control it. This is due to the process of voting, which is something the final product would ideally contain, however since that is a feature that requires a lot of pre-requisites I will only be adding it to the project if there is time, although it will be theorised in [chapter 2.5, "The Protocol"](../2.5-the-protocol/2.5.3-consensus-algorithm/2.5.3.5-voting.md).

### Storing Data

#### State Root

This is a concept that has been inspired by Ethereum's feature of the same name and allows the state of all wallets and stores in the blockchain to be tracked simply using a hash of the current state of the entire system in each block. The idea here is that nodes should hold the latest copy of all the contents of every user's wallets, and that a hash of this state root should be stored in every new block such that when a node connects to the network they can get collect the state root from a different node, verify it to the latest block's state root hash and if it is valid, then continue computing from there.

This massively lowers the amount of computations a node has to do per transaction validation, because without this nodes would have to travel back throughout the entire blockchain looking for proof of ownership of an item that is to be transacted.

[(Ethereum, 2015)](../reference-list.md)

#### Storing Blocks

The more blocks a node stores, the better. However they do not need to store them all, as long as nodes know multiple other nodes who store a copy of each block there isn't any major downside to a node only storing a portion of the total blocks in the blockchain.

Yet there is a catch to this, if all nodes begin to only store the most recent blocks then the current existence of the blockchain and all user's wallet contents will be fine and continue as normal but the transaction history for the blockchain will be erased.

This could be looked at as a benefit of the system because it technically increases anonymity whilst retaining function, but in certain cases it could be an issue. The reason this is an accepted risk is because the storage gains and general computational benefits are great enough as a network like this scales and this risk is low enough that it is a worthy risk to take.&#x20;

### Keeping Block Creation Secure

This is vital to the survival and usefulness of a blockchain, and in the case of the MonoChain is done in two ways:

1. Identifying blocks using the hashes of their parents to ensure if a block is tampered, all hashes after that block become invalid and the chain is broken.
2. [The Consensus protocol "Proof of Worth"](../2.5-the-protocol/2.5.3-consensus-algorithm/2.5.3.1-proof-of-worth-the-bullet-point-summary..md) is used to cut down on the amount of times each node has to validate transactions from each other node.

**The first method**, identifying and chaining the blocks using hashes is detailed in the ["chaining blocks section"](1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution.md#chaining-blocks) further up this page.

**The second method**, is a custom designed Consensus Protocol called "Proof of Worth". (This protocol can be seen in a technical summary [here](../2.5-the-protocol/2.5.3-consensus-algorithm/2.5.3.1-proof-of-worth-the-bullet-point-summary..md)). The base concept behind this protocol is to use a trust factor based system that stores, monitors and changes the values of each node's "trustworthiness" within an integer value called that node's "trust". This value can be altered up or down by one unit per each block, with the default node mining software being designed to give a node that helps it a trust increase and a trust decrease to nodes that lie to it.

This then means that as nodes make positive contributions to the blockchain their trust ratings will increase and as bad actors make negative contributions their trust ratings will decrease. Hence when a user wishes to create a transaction, they will be able to choose to send their transaction to a well rated node, which will likely have an increased fee and waiting time, or a worse rated node, which will likely to have a lower fee and waiting time. However this also increases the risk of their transaction not be validated properly and require re-sending.

## The Webportal

#### Initially the webportal will contain a few primary sections:

* A Homepage to explain the project.
* A 'Learn More' page to explain some of the more technical side of the project in more detail
* And some form of link to the source code as well as any other relevant external documents.

#### Then as the project progresses and reaches a point at which transactions can be completed it should gain:

* A Wallet page which allows users to generate or load their wallets to see the contents and what they are storing.
* A Marketplace which allows the purchase and sale of data, currency and other blockchain items to other users on the network.

In this case the primary sections will be developed early on in the projects development and are essential, with the secondary sections being important but not being truly essential to the project's use.

## Limitations

### Performance

Although I would like to make it so that any person with a spare computer could help compute towards this blockchain as a node and receive as much of a reward as someone with a top of the line server, due to the nature of this project being computationally complex, the more powerful a computer is, the more useful it is to the system.

This is because nodes need to not only do thousands of checks, data requests, node-to-node communications and general computations per block validation, but they need to be able to do so fast enough to be a part of the validation of a block that makes it on to the blockchain in order to actually receive a reward.

Therefore the blockchain system itself will be limited by the capabilities of its nodes and the nodes will be limited by the relative performance of themselves to the other nodes on the network.
