## The whole internet: [Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0)

For the past few years there have been rumours of the beginnings of a new form of web: [Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0). This form of web promises the beginnings of a fully fleshed virtual world where people own their own data, where there are no oligopolies that control the tech world and instead groups of users will have direct input into how control is distributed and how the internet should evolve. This project is not going to promise any of that, in all likelihood it will not be the start of a digital revolution that results in the destruction of Google and Facebook, instead this project will likely be a part of the slow transition towards some form of future that intends to be as the one I mentioned&#x20;

How will this actually effect the everyday person? Well, simply put it'll change the nature of what is possible on the internet and how they will interact with and use the internet, not in any kind of groundbreaking sudden way but they will notice it more in the wave of new technologies that they can use that come along due to "[Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0)". This will be like how the addition of [backend](../terminology.md#backend-server) servers and user-specific code that changed what it did based upon who was viewing the website allowed the generation of internet that created social media, entertainment streaming systems and many other systems that were not possible with non-personalised, static websites.
