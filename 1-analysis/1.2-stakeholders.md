## The whole internet: [Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0)

For the past few years there have been rumours of the beginnings of a new form of web: [Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0). This form of web promises the beginnings of a fully fleshed virtual world where people own their own data, where there are no oligopolies that control the tech world and instead groups of users will have direct input into how control is distributed and how the internet should evolve. This project is not going to promise any of that, in all likelihood it will not be the start of a digital revolution that results in the destruction of Google and Facebook, instead this project will likely be a part of the slow transition towards some form of future that intends to be as the one I mentioned&#x20;

How will this actually effect the everyday person? Well, simply put it'll change the nature of what is possible on the internet and how they will interact with and use the internet, not in any kind of groundbreaking sudden way but they will notice it more in the wave of new technologies that they can use that come along due to "[Web 3.0](../terminology.md#web-3.0)". This will be like how the addition of [backend](../terminology.md#backend-server) servers and user-specific code that changed what it did based upon who was viewing the website allowed the generation of internet that created social media, entertainment streaming systems and many other systems that were not possible with non-personalised, static websites.

## Content Creators

One group who will massively affected by this shift will be content creators, as currently the measure of who owns a piece of content is whoever uploaded it to a given platform first, and if it reaches a larger scale, whoever has the most money to win a legal battle.

The shift to blockchain oriented platforms will allow content creators to upload their content to a platform which will then "mint" the content on the blockchain (likely including a smart contract clause to give the minting platform a small cut of the revenue for all future transactions) and will act as a proof of ownership for the content across multiple platforms. Although this will require platforms to agree on a general protocol in order to be able to accept each others ownership certificates, but this should hopefully be able to be implemented by having the protocol being implemented from the beginning, which I aim to do in a later part of this project.

Now although it is worth bearing in mind that if someone other than the original content creator mints the ownership certificate, it will likely result in a legal battle and simply transferring the certificate to the actual owner would leave the uploader's smart contract attached, which would allow them to continue to collect a cut of the actual owner's revenue when they shouldn't, so the smart contract must also be directly editable during a transaction (assuming that the sender signs this) but only sections added by the sender should be editable.

The benefits of this model, if it is implemented correctly, is that content creators will be able to not only have a certificate of ownership for their content, but also be able to sell that certificate, allowing them to "sell" their videos or even gift them. An example of this is if an investor wanted to get in on a creator's success, they could purchase pieces of content from them and hopefully gain the revenue from them in the future, alternatively if a content creator wanted to give a charity the revenue from a video they could gift them the certificate of ownership, or edit the certificate to specify to send the revenue directly to the charity if they still wanted ownership of the video.

In the latter scenario the ownership certificate could even be split up into multiple sub-sections, this could work by only allowing the current owner of each section (there could be an "owner" of the video and a "revenue" holder)
