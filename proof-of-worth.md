# Proof of Worth

In order to create the proof of worth census that this blockchain will run on we need to first initialise the first Leader node, don't worry I'll explain what a leader node is and how it can be created later but it's important to know that there will need to be an initial leader node and that will need to be hosted by the creator of the blockchain.
