This is the example node program for mining on the MonoChain network.

Mining is a process based upon giving up some of your computer's power to a blockchain network.
In exchange, you receive a small percentage of any transactions that are processed on your computer in MonoCoins,
the standard currency for the MonoChain network.

To start working for the MonoChain Network you will first need to allow other nodes to connect to your computer,
this will be through a http connection that requires some kind of open port, this can be done through port forwarding (less recommended),
through a cloudflare tunnel (highly recommended) or any other method.

Once you've set up a way for other nodes to communicate with yours all you have to do is run the executable file titled "main" in this folder.
Then it will guide you through the set up steps.
