# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Node Refactor

## Basics (remove once filled out):

* Node stuff:
  *   Switched keys to separate module.

      * Development issues:
        * Generated a small error regarding files not being openable, this is because I switched to using `./monochain/file` instead of just using `./file`
          * Error due to vlang's file writer not being able to open files in directories that don't exist yet, so the directories must be created first during the file opening cycle.
        * Massive error: "SIGSEGV"
          * This is a massive downside of the V language and makes the program very difficult to debug.
          * Very difficult to debug as there is no line number for this kind of error, the error just exists somewhere in the code and it may not even be the code, it could be the compiler.
          * Issue was due to a type declaration loop.
            * In cryptography/main.v the struct Keys was defined as Keys {KeysType} and the type KeysType was defined as Keys



## Design

### Objectives

After beginning to plan out the slightly more advanced inter nodal communication [(which should be in a later cycle not too much later than this one)](needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md) I have come to the realisation that housing the cryptography and configuration module in the same place is probably not a good idea.&#x20;

This is because after a few experiments I realised that without editing and recompiling it, the V-Web module that I'm using to host the api routes for the nodes currently prevents the loading of custom non-public variables into the web object to be used within those routes. What that means is that I can't setup the node's cryptography keys to be passed around the node whenever it receives a new api request without making them public and accessible by all parts of the program (which isn't great for security) and hence need to find a work around.

There are two main options here:

1. Reload the configuration object every time the program needs the cryptography keys to do anything.
2. Store the keys as a separate object and just reload them when they're needed.

Since separating the configuration and key objects helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded and saved per time unit and is better for security, I will be going with the second option.

* [ ] Separate the keys into their own object.
* [ ] Allow the private key to remain private and unusable from any non-direct functionality
* [ ] Refactor any sections of code that need to be updated to support this new method&#x20;
* [ ] Fix any newly generated errors and get back to at least what was working before this refactor

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

### Key Variables

| Variable Name                    | Use                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <pre><code>Keys</code></pre>     | This is the keys object that holds the private and public keys as-well as some functions for using these keys (sign, verify, etc). |
| <pre><code>key_path</code></pre> | This is a string that represents the path of the file where the keys object is stored and loaded from.                             |

### Pseudocode

## Development

The end result for this code involves two files, one of which handles the creation and functions of the keys object, and the other handles the loading, saving and creation of that object.

The benefit of this is that it allows the private key to remain as a private property so that the only functions that can access it are those that are a part of the keys object and used for signing data. Therefore although if part of the program was infected with some kind of malware it would allow that malware to sign data/transactions which is obviously not good, it wouldn't give them access to the keys directly hence making it harder for the bad actor responsible for the malware to copy the keys and gain complete control of the wallet.

### Outcome

#### The keys object.

This is the object that stores both the private, public key and the two key functions that need access to private key. The first being the sign function which signs data using the private key, and the validate function that ensures the public and private key within the object are matching and work together.

<pre class="language-v"><code class="lang-v"><strong>// /packages/node/src/modules/cryptography/main.v
</strong><strong>module cryptography	// this module
</strong>import crypto.ed25519 as dsa	// an external module used to handle all the dsa stuff - too complicated for the time scope of this project.

pub struct Keys {
	priv_key []u8	//dsa.PrivateKey
	pub: 
		pub_key []u8	//dsa.PublicKey
}

type KeysType = Keys

pub fn (this Keys) validate_keys() bool {
	data := "Hello, world!".bytes()		// defines some random data to check a key pair with
	signature := this.sign(data)	// signs that data using tthe private key
	verified := verify(this.pub_key, data, signature)		// validate that data with that signature and key pair
	if verified == false {	// if verification failed
		eprintln("Signature verification failed")
		exit(130)	// exit with error code 130
	} else {	// verification succeeded
		println("Signature verified")
		return true	// valid so return true
	}
}

pub fn (this Keys) sign(data []u8) []u8 {
	// wrap the sign function to prevent having conditional data throughout program.
	signature := dsa.sign(this.priv_key, data) or {
		eprintln("Error signing data")
		exit(140)
	}
	return signature
}

pub fn verify(public_key dsa.PublicKey, data []u8, signature []u8) bool {
	// wrap verify function to prevent having conditional data throughout program.
	verified := dsa.verify(public_key, data, signature) or {
		eprintln("Error verifying data")
		return false
	}
	return verified
}	</code></pre>

#### The keys handler.

This is what allows the keys to be stored, loaded and generated into the keys object.

```v
// V code from /packages/node/src/modules/cryptography/keyHandling.v
module cryptography
import utils
import crypto.ed25519 as dsa
import json

fn failed_to_get_keys(key_path string) (Keys){
	println("Could not load keys from file, would you like to generate a new pair?")
	if utils.ask_for_bool(0) {
		new_keys := gen_keys()
		failed := utils.save_file(key_path, json.encode(new_keys), 0)
		if failed {
			println("Cannot continue, exiting...")
			exit(215)
		}
		return new_keys
	} else {
		eprintln("Cannot operate without a keypair, Exiting...")
		exit(1)
	}
}

pub fn get_keys(key_path string) (Keys) {
	raw := utils.read_file(key_path, true)

	if !raw.loaded {
		return failed_to_get_keys(key_path)
	}

	keys := json.decode(Keys, raw.data) or {
		return failed_to_get_keys(key_path)
	}

	println("Keys loaded from file.")
	return keys
}

pub fn gen_keys() (Keys) {
	// This is just a wrapper function to prevent the rest of the code having to deal with keys being incorrectly generated
	// throughout the rest of the program

	public_key, private_key := dsa.generate_key() or {
		eprintln("Error generating keys")
		exit(150)
	}
	keys := Keys{
		pub_key: public_key,
		priv_key: private_key,
	}

	keys.validate_keys()

	return keys
}v
```

## Challenges

There were two key challenges to overcome during this development phase, the first one being a challenge I knew I'd have to overcome and the second being a very annoying bug. I've split these challenges into two separate sections for the sake of ease of reading.

### Managing the storage of multiple files

Since the configuration settings are already saved in their own file and I am now going to be saving the keys in a separate file and I don't want to keep dumping files into the user's home directory, it's probably a good idea to start storing files within a folder to keep everything in one place.

Hence all&#x20;
