# 2.2.13 Cycle 13 - Sending messages across the network

## Design

### Objectives

Since the project is getting near the end of the time period allowed for development and the validation/transaction part of the blockchain doesn't exist outside of the theoretical space yet, but the majority communication layer is nearly finished I think it would be a good idea to get general communication working such that by the end of the allowed period of development the project exists in a form that is somewhat usable.

This form would effectively end up being a decentralised messaging service, which although is not quite the full blockchain that I was aiming for in the first place, still utilises a lot of the same networking and logic - due to effectively being a demo of the decentralised communication layer.

To do this, I will need to introduce a few new features that will build upon what I have created in previous cycles:

* [ ] Generating message objects that state who created the object and provides a signature to prove it.
* [ ] Sending these messages to all references stored on the node.
* [ ] Receiving, validating, logging and forwarding these messages.

With these features the messages being sent will be very similar to the transactions that were initially hypothesised in the analysis of this project, however instead of being sent in bulk during block creation, will instead be sent individually whenever nodes feel like it.

This will then allow for the adaption of these messages into blocks in a future cycle if there is enough time to continue on this path, meaning that in any form this is not a detour of the theorised final project, just a way to create a demo that uses everything that has been created so far.

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

### Key Variables

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.
