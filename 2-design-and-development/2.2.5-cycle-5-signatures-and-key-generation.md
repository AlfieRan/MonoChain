# 2.2.5 Cycle 5 - Signatures and Key Generation

* Choose the DSA algorithm for fast verification
* Generate DSA key pairs
* Created wrappers for the pre-existing functions
* Built a verification function to check the new key pair

## Design

### Objectives

The next module that needs implementing and introducing to the code base is the cryptography side, this is the part of the code that allows a node to sign things and to validate other wallet's transactions and signatures.

This will be done through either the RSA or DSA algorithm, as these are the most common and well-known signature algorithms and I can be sure that they work without having to design and test my own signature algorithm.

* [ ] Choose between the RSA and DSA algorithm
* [ ] Implement the algorithm key generation using either a pre-made library or a custom built solution
* [ ] Generate key pairs for the chosen algorithm
* [ ] Build a verification function to ensure the key pair was generated properly by signing some random data and checking it.

### Usability Features

* The ability to generate keys as needed if the user doesn't have any to reduce friction.
* Once key pair has been either inputted or generated the user shouldn't have to worry about them during the Node's run time.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| private\_key  | This is a private key that should not be shared and is used to sign data.                                                                                                                    |
| public\_key   | This is a publicly available key derived from the private key that can be used to validate that a specific private key produced a signature. Can also be used as an identifier for a wallet. |

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome
