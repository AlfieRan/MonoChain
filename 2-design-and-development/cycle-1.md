# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this first cycle I am to build out the frameworks for my project. This will include: a web portal for showcasing the project, letting users create wallets and send/receive data to and from their wallets, explaining the rules of the blockchain and the interfaces that can be used to interact with it; a node program that will act as a program that users can download and run to host the blockchain on their device and contribute to the project; and a utils package that holds code and types needed by both the web-portal and the node.

Because of the fact that this relies on three separate packages and it may need additional packages in the future the ideal solution for this code base is a monorepo, therefore my&#x20;
