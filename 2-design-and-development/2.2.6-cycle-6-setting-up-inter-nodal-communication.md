# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 - Setting up Inter-Nodal Communication

* Implemented ping/pong architecture
* Attach these keys and signing to the ping/pong method to verify node's identity

## Design

### Objectives

Now that a lot of the structure of the project has been built up and I have a bit more of an idea where I want to head with the design of the software it's time to start actually putting together the actual networking side of the blockchain. This is arguably the most important part as it was what  allows the blockchain to function properly and securely.

Therefore for this cycle the objectives are to setup some kind of basic communication between nodes, which I will be doing through the use of a ping/pong API which will allow nodes to request other nodes to sign some example data [(using the cryptography functionality from the last cycle)](2.2.5-cycle-5-signatures-and-key-generation.md) to check that they are online and owned by the wallet they claimed to be owned by.&#x20;

* [ ] Create a new api route "/pong"
* [ ] Read messages sent to the api route and sign the date data sent to them
* [ ] Respond with the signature, the public key used by the node and the original message so the node who ponged can be sure that the response is correct

### Usability Features

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
