# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Improved Webportal (Mobile Support)

## Design

### Objectives

Now that basic inter-nodal communication, cryptography and some other essentials are setup for the node software I think it's a good time to work on the webportal a bit more and I also to happen to have noticed that at this point the webportal does not render very well on mobile, so that's a good place to start.

* [x] Fix the rendering issues on mobile
* [x] Implement a separate navigation bar on mobile that is easier to use
* [x] Improve the home page.
* [x] Add some navigation buttons on the homepage (Inspired by [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org))

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mobile        | A boolean value which tells the navigation component whether to render the mobile or desktop view.                          |
| window        | An object that stores the width and height of the browser window to be used to calculate the value for the mobile variable. |
| breakpoint    | An integer value which when the width of window is less than, the mobile navigation bar is enabled.                         |

### Pseudocode

The code for the rendering issues are mainly just css changes to ensure that as many browser sizes as possible are supported, therefore there's not really any pseudocode to be written.

However for the new navigation bar and the new buttons on the home screen there is some actual code to write.

Starting with the new navigation bar, this will introduce two 'react hooks' that allows the 'mobile' variable referenced in key variables to be generated every time the window changes size. The first one will be called 'useWindowSize()' and will be kept in a separate file to the navigation bar file incase it is useful in other parts of the website later on, and the second hook being a basic one that re-renders any time the window variable referencing the 'useWindowSize()' hook changes.

**The 'useWindowSize()' hook**

```tsx
// useWindowSize Hook
FUNCTION useWindowSize():
  // generate the window size variable
  windowSize = {
    width: 0
    height: 0
  }

  // Handler to call on window resize
  FUNCTION handleResize():
    // Set window width/height to state
    window = {
      width: window.innerWidth,
      height: window.innerHeight,
    }
  END FUNCTION

 RELOAD_ON_CHANGE (window):
    IF (window != "undefined"):
      // Add event listener to call handleResize everytime the window is resized.
      window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

      // Call handler right away so state gets updated with initial window size
      handleResize();

      // Remove event listener on cleanup
      RETURN window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    END IF
  END RELOAD_ON_CHANGE
  
  RETURN windowSize;
END FUNCTION
```

**The mobile navigation bar hook**

```tsx
// initialise the nav bar as desktop
mobile = false

// set the breakpoint as a width of 700 pixels
breakpoint = 700

RELOAD_ON_CHANGE (window.width):
    // reloads any time the window.width changes

    IF (window.width < breakpoint):
      mobile = true
      
    ELSE IF (window.width > breakpoint):
      mobile = false
      
    END IF
END
```

## Development

Most of the development for implementing these changes were pretty simple as the logic for deciding whether to use the mobile or desktop nav bar is very simple and the buttons have basically no logic, so although it looks like a lot of code, most of it is just styling and layering to make it actually look nice and reusable in different parts of the website.

Although if I switch web hosting providors at somepoint between writing this (26/10/22) and when you are reading it then the link will probably not work anymore.

### Outcome - Navigation Bar

**useWindowSize() Hook**

This simply just generates a few variables and functions that will run and change the value of the `windowSize` variable as the window object - an object supplied by the browser and not written by myself - changes in size and shape.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// Hook
export default function useWindowSize() {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState<{
    width: undefined | number;
    height: undefined | number;
  }>({
    width: undefined,
    height: undefined,
  });

  // Handler to call on window resize
  function handleResize() {
    // Set window width/height to state
    setWindowSize({
      width: window.innerWidth,
      height: window.innerHeight,
    });
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // only execute all the code below in client side
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      // Add event listener
      window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

      // Call handler right away so state gets updated with initial window size
      handleResize();

      // Remove event listener on cleanup
      return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    }
  }, []); // Empty array ensures that effect is only run on mount
  return windowSize;
}
```

**Mobile hook**

Since this code is part of the NavBar component, there's a lot more code that isn't relevant here so this only shows the relevant code, but the entire file can be found [here](https://github.com/AlfieRan/MonoChain/blob/8215f151e70625a9f08254186899b2d097bb4bb2/packages/webportal/src/component/NavBar.tsx). As shown below this code simply changes the state of the 'mobile' variable as the width of the window goes above or below the 'breakpoint' variable - currently set to 700 pixels.

```tsx
const NavBar = () => {
  // there is some other code ran here

  // generate the required constants
  const window = useWindowSize();
  const breakpoint = 700;
  const [mobile, setMobile] = useState<boolean>(true);
  
  // create the hook
  useEffect(() => {
    if ((window.width || 0) < breakpoint) {
      setMobile(true);
    } else if ((window.width || 0) > breakpoint) {
      setMobile(false);
    }
  }, [window.width]);
  
  
  // then moves onto to the code for some other hooks & the actual components
}
```

#### The mobile and desktop rendering splitter

Once again, this code is part of the NavBar component, but since that file is so big and including all of it would make it unclear which parts have been changed, so only relevant sections have been included here.

The top section shows the desktop navigation bar, with the div that houses it having the parameter `hidden={mobile}` such that as the mobile view is toggled it will disappear from the user's view and then the mobile navigation component will appear - shown by the parameter `hidden={!mobile}`

```tsx
<div hidden={mobile}>
  <Flex css={NavBarCss} justifyContent={"center"}>
    {Links.map((data) => {
      if (data.type === "component") {
        return (
          <Flex flexDir={"column"} key={data.name}>
            <Button
              bg={""}
              my={0}
              mx={LinkMarginAmount}
              p={0}
              _hover={LinkHover}
              _active={LinkHover}
              onClick={() => {
                data.state.change(!data.state.value);
              }}
            >
              <Text
                fontSize={"xl"}
                fontWeight={"normal"}
                h={"full"}
                w={"full"}
                lineHeight={"base"}
                pt={1.5}
              >
                {data.name}
              </Text>
            </Button>
          </Flex>
        );
      } else {
        return (
          <Link
            key={data.name}
            href={data.href}
            mx={LinkMarginAmount}
            isExternal={!!data.external}
            _hover={LinkHover}
          >
            <Text fontSize={"xl"} h={"full"} w={"full"} pt={1.5}>
              {data.name}
            </Text>
          </Link>
        );
      }
    })}
  </Flex>
  {Links.filter((item) => item.type === "component").map((data) => {
    if (data.type === "component") {
      return (
        <Collapse key={data.name} in={data.state.value} dir="top">
          <data.comp />
        </Collapse>
      );
    }
  })}
</div>
<MobileNav hidden={!mobile} />
```

#### Movile Navigation component

This is the component that is shown to users who are on mobile devices - or any browser with a window width of less than 700 pixels and simply represents a toggle-able side menu that can open and close as the user wishes. This is in exchange for the desktop navigation bar which has all the options along the top of the screen and is not toggle-able.

```tsx
import {
  Button,
  Drawer,
  DrawerBody,
  DrawerContent,
  DrawerHeader,
  DrawerOverlay,
  Flex,
  Link,
  Text,
  useDisclosure,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { NavBarCss } from "../styles/navBar";
import { scaling_button } from "../styles/buttons";
import React from "react";

const MobileNav = (props: { hidden?: boolean }) => {
  const Links: { name: string; href: string }[] = [
    { name: "Home", href: "/" },
    { name: "Learn More", href: "/info" },
    { name: "Wallet", href: "/wallet" },
  ];

  const {
    isOpen: menuOpen,
    onOpen: menuOnOpen,
    onClose: menuOnClose,
  } = useDisclosure();

  if (props.hidden) return null;
  return (
    <>
      <Flex
        css={NavBarCss}
        justifyContent={"space-between"}
        alignItems={"center"}
      >
        <Flex css={scaling_button()} pl={2}>
          <Link _hover={{ textDecoration: "none" }} href={"/"}>
            <Text m={2}>Home</Text>
          </Link>
        </Flex>
        <Button css={scaling_button()} onClick={menuOnOpen} px={3}>
          <Text m={2}>Menu</Text>
        </Button>
      </Flex>

      <Drawer placement="right" onClose={menuOnClose} isOpen={menuOpen}>
        <DrawerOverlay />
        <DrawerContent>
          <DrawerHeader borderBottomWidth="2px">
            <Flex
              dir={"row"}
              w={"100%"}
              justifyContent={"space-between"}
              alignItems={"center"}
            >
              <Text>MonoChain</Text>
              <Button css={scaling_button()} onClick={menuOnClose}>
                X
              </Button>
            </Flex>
          </DrawerHeader>
          <DrawerBody>
            {Links.map((linkObj) => (
              <Link
                href={linkObj.href}
                _hover={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
                key={linkObj.name}
              >
                <Flex
                  borderWidth={"2px"}
                  borderRadius={"lg"}
                  my={3}
                  p={2}
                  fontSize={"lg"}
                  bg={"rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}
                  _active={{ bg: "rgba(0,0,0,0.2)" }}
                >
                  <Text>{linkObj.name}</Text>
                </Flex>
              </Link>
            ))}
          </DrawerBody>
        </DrawerContent>
      </Drawer>
    </>
  );
};

export default MobileNav;
```

### Outcome - Homepage buttons

Since the buttons to be produced will all be identical apart form their contents and where they send the user, the button only needs to be coded once and can then be looped over for each item in an array of contexts for the button to show.

#### The context info for the buttons

This is simple an array of objects which abide by the type 'gridItemProps' such that they all have exactly the same parameters and are easily usable by the button code.

```tsx
type gridItemProps = {
  link: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
};

const gridItems: gridItemProps[] = [
    {
      link: "/wallet",
      title: "Wallet",
      subtitle: "Create and manage your wallet.",
    },
    {
      link: "/info",
      title: "Learn More",
      subtitle: "Learn more about the MonoChain.",
    },
    {
      link: "/download",
      title: "Setup a Node",
      subtitle:
        "Download a node to support the MonoChain in exchange for a fee.",
    },
    {
      link: "https://github.com/AlfieRan/A-Level-Project",
      title: "View the Code",
      subtitle: "View the open source code for the default Node and webportal.",
    },
  ];
```

#### The button code

This turns the data supplied by each of the objects within the 'gridItems' array into a button with the context supplied by that object.

```tsx
<Grid gridTemplateColumns={["repeat(1, 1fr)", "repeat(2, 1fr)"]}>
  {gridItems.map((item) => (
    <GridItem
      key={item.title}
      m={2}
      maxW={"100%"}
      w={["4xs", "md"]}
      h={["2xs", "xs"]}
    >
      <Link
        href={item.link}
        _hover={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
        w={"100%"}
        h={"100%"}
      >
        <Center
          w={"100%"}
          h={"100%"}
          p={2}
          bg={"rgba(100,100,255,0.2)"}
          transitionDuration={"0.15s"}
          _hover={{
            bg: "rgba(100,100,255,0.3)",
            transform: "scale(1.03)",
          }}
          _active={{
            bg: "rgba(100,100,255,0.1)",
            transform: "scale(0.97)",
          }}
          borderRadius={"xl"}
          flexDir={"column"}
        >
          <Text fontSize={"2xl"} fontWeight={"semibold"}>
            {item.title}
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>{item.subtitle}</Text>
        </Center>
      </Link>
    </GridItem>
  ))}
</Grid>
```

### Challenges

The main challenge of this cycle was simply just tweaking css enough to ensure that the new ui looks good on as many devices and resolutions as possible, which involved changing my simulated resolution using the chrome developer tools to ensure that it looked good.&#x20;

## Testing

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>What actually happens</th><th data-type="checkbox">Passed?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Navigate throughout the website on a desktop/laptop device</td><td>The website to stay "intact" with no components becomming hidden or breaking.</td><td>As Expected</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Navigate throughout the website on a phone/small device</td><td>The website to stay "intact" with no components becomming hidden or breaking.</td><td>As Expected</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Open the site on desktop device.</td><td>The desktop styled navigation bar should appear along the top of the screen.</td><td>As Expected</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Open the site on mobile device.</td><td>The mobile styled navigation bar should appear with a menu button to open and close the bulk of the contents.</td><td>As Expected</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Evidence

#### Test 1 & 3

This showcases the evidence for both test 1 and 3, both of which are regarding the site on a desktop device as is emulated here.

#### Test 2 & 4

This showcases the evidence for both test 2 and 4, both of which are regarding the site on a mobile device as is emulated here. (In this case an iPhone 13 Pro Max was chosen to be emulated.)
