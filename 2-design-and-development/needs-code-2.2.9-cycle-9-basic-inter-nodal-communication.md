# \[needs code] 2.2.10 Cycle 10 - Basic Inter-Nodal Communication

* STOP NODES FROM JUST SIGNING ALL DATA SENT THEIR WAY -> MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW
* Convert pong route from a get request to a post request
* move pong request data from query to body
* create an info getter that just asks a node for all it's info in more detail.

## Design

### Objectives

The objective for this cycle is to turn the [basic inter-nodal communication from Cycle 6](2.2.6-cycle-6-setting-up-inter-nodal-communication.md) into something more advanced, allowing Nodes to start remembering their neighbours, track their neighbouring node's wallet references and let other nodes know they exist using the ping/pong functionality setup in Cycle 6.

* [ ] Nodes store references to other Nodes.
* [ ] Nodes remember which wallet was running on each Node it has a reference to.
* [ ] Nodes can let other Nodes know that they exist using the ping/pong functionality setup in Cycle 5.

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome
