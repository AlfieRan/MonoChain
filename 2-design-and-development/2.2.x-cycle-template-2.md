# 2.2.13 Cycle 13 - Introducing a sql database

## Design

New required packages:

* Docker
* Postgres
* libpq

### Objectives

Now that you can send messages between nodes, it's time to introduce a way of storing these messages and the best way in which I can think of that to be done is by creating a local database such that the node can store and load data onto that database and use it as it's memory. The benefit of introducing a database for this reason also means that the references that were introduced in [Cycle 11 - Remembering Nodes](needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md) can be moved to the database for faster and better storage.

The way I'm going to go to do this is through the use of docker, which is a service for generating containerised "virtual machines" that \*should\* run identically no matter the hardware. This means all the program has to do is tell docker to generate a postgreSQL database image and as long as the user has docker installed, it should then be able to be connect and use this just like it would any other database.

PostgreSQL was chosen because V - the language the node is written in - supports it and I have used it in other projects before so should be able to work with it easily.

* [ ] Generate a postgreSQL docker container and connect to it upon startup
* [ ] Build the postgreSQL table with required fields.
* [ ] Refactor references to use the database rather than the json file used at the moment.
* [ ] &#x20;Save messages to the database and only forward them through the network if the node hasn't seen it before.

## Development

Although all the code shown in this cycle does not mention web-sockets, it is worth mentioning that whilst during the development of this cycle I was primarily working on switching from using json files to a database, I was also starting to work on the web-socket functionality that will be shown in the next cycle, hence the code for this cycle is available [here](https://github.com/AlfieRan/MonoChain/tree/87ba2384fec10ec52b22ebe15c1a0550bfd4a891) but exploring outside the database module will show evidence of code that is referenced in the next cycle.&#x20;

On that note, all of the following code is available in separate files within the 'database' file, stored at `/packages/node/src/modules/database/` with the specific file names commented at the top of the code below.

### Outcome

#### Creating and handling the docker container

This code allows the node software to send direct bash commands to the Operating System and through that create, start and stop a docker container which houses the postgreSQL database used by the software.

```v
// found at /database/containerHandling.v
module database

// external imports
import os
import time

// config constants
pub const image_name = "monochain-postgresql"
pub const db_name = "postgres"
pub const db_password = "password"

// shell commands
const init_psql_docker = "docker run --name $image_name -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$db_password -d postgres"
const start_psql_docker = "docker start $image_name"
const stop_psql_docker = "docker stop $image_name"

// returns whether or not the command executed properly
fn sh(cmd string) bool {
  println("[shell] > $cmd")
  executed := os.execute(cmd)
  print("[shell] - $executed.output")

  // 0 means the command executed properly
  return executed.exit_code == 0 
}

pub fn launch(){
  	println("[Database] Launching database...")
  	// try to start the container
  	started := sh(start_psql_docker)

  	if !started {
		println("[Database] No database found, or other error, trying to initialise a new database...")
		initialised := sh(init_psql_docker)

		if !initialised {
			eprintln("\n\n[Database] Could not start or initialise database container, docker is probably not running.")
			exit(300)
		}

		println("[Database] Database initialised successfully.")
  	}
	time.sleep(3 * time.second)
  	println("[Database] Database running.")
}

pub fn stop(){
	println("[Database] Stopping database...")
	stopped := sh(stop_psql_docker)

	if !stopped {
		eprintln("[Database] Failed to stop database, may be due to container not existing, please check docker yourself...")
	} else {
		println("[Database] Stopped database.")
	}
}
```

#### Interfacing with the database and creating relevant tables

The way in which the postgreSQL module works in vlang is to create a struct that represents a table and then to use it in the table's generation, hence a lot of this section of code is just constants and structs to handle these tables and connect to the database in the first place.

The second half of the code is then just to connect to the database and create the tables based upon those references.

<pre class="language-v"><code class="lang-v">// found at /database/postgresInterface.v
<strong>module database
</strong>
// external imports
import pg

// config constants
const host = "localhost"
const port = 5432

const config = pg.Config{
	host: host
	port: port
	user: "postgres"
	password: db_password
	dbname: db_name
}


pub struct Http_Reference {
	pub:
		id        	int    	[primary; sql: serial; sql_type: 'SERIAL']	// just for the db
		domain     	string 	[default: '']	// domain of node
		key        	string 	// key that is attached to node
		last_connected 		string	[default: 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'; sql_type: 'TIMESTAMP']	// when the reference was last used
}

pub struct Message_Table {
	pub:
		id        	int    	[primary; sql: serial; sql_type: 'SERIAL']	// just for the db
		timestamp  	string 	[default: 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'; sql_type: 'TIMESTAMP']	// when the message was sent
		sender     	string	// key of the sender
		receiver   	string	// key of the receiver
		contents   	string 	// conetnts of the message
		signature  	string	// the signature of the message 
}

pub struct DatabaseConnection {
	pub mut:
		connection pg.DB
}

// interfacing with the tables using the pg module
pub fn connect(over_ride_config bool, supplied_config pg.Config) DatabaseConnection {
	mut config_to_use := config

	if over_ride_config {
		config_to_use = supplied_config
	}

	connection := pg.connect(config_to_use) or {
		eprintln("[Database] Could not connect to database, docker container probably not running.\n[Database] Raw error: $err\n[Database] There is a chance this was due to trying to connect before the database was ready, if so restarting the program should fix it.")
		exit(310)
	}

	db := DatabaseConnection{connection: connection}

	println("[Database] Connected to database. ($host:$port)")
	
	println("[Database] Creating tables...")
	db.init_tables()
	return db
}

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) init_tables() {
	println("[Database] Creating http reference table...")
	sql db.connection {
		create table Http_Reference
	}
	println("[Database] Creating message table...")
	sql db.connection {
		create table Message_Table
	}
	println("[Database] Tables created.\n")
}</code></pre>

#### Some basic wrappers used for key functionality&#x20;

These wrapper functions exist so that if a user wanted to change the node software to use a different database type or module, they would only have to change the code in the database module and wouldn't have to change sql requests in external modules.

```v
// found at /database/queryCreator.v
module database

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) get_message(parsed_signature string, parsed_sender string, parsed_receiver string, time string, data string) []Message_Table {
	existing_message := sql db.connection {
		select from Message_Table where signature == parsed_signature && sender == parsed_sender && receiver == parsed_receiver && timestamp == time && contents == data limit 3
	}
	return existing_message
}

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) get_latest_messages(offset_quantity int, num int) []Message_Table {
	println("[Database] Getting latest messages")
	existing_message := sql db.connection {
		select from Message_Table where id > 0 order by timestamp desc limit num offset offset_quantity 
	}
	return existing_message
}

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) save_message(message Message_Table) {
	sql db.connection {
		insert message into Message_Table
	}
}
```

#### References refactor file

This is very similar to the original references file, but is simply adjusted to using databases rather than the old json method, so I won't go into too much detail on it but I've added it below as it will be tested in the tests at the end of this cycle.

```v
// found at /database/references.v
module database

import time

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) aware_of(input_domain string) bool {
	println("[Database] Checking if domain $input_domain is in database")
	http_matches := sql db.connection {
		select from Http_Reference where domain == input_domain order by last_connected limit 2
	}

	if http_matches.len > 0  {
		println("[Database] Found a reference to $input_domain")
		return true
	}

	println("[Database] No reference to $input_domain found.")
	return false
}

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) get_key_http(input_domain string) []u8 {
	ref := sql db.connection {
		select from Http_Reference where domain == input_domain order by last_connected limit 1
	}

	return ref.key.bytes()
}


pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) create_ref(input_domain string, pubkey []u8) bool {
	println("[Database] Checking if a reference to $input_domain already exists")
	if db.aware_of(input_domain) {
		println("[Database] Reference to $input_domain already exists, updating it...")
		db.submit_update(input_domain, pubkey)
		return true
	}

	println("[Database] Creating reference for $input_domain")
	db.submit_create(input_domain, pubkey)
	println("[Database] Reference created successfully")
	return true
}


fn (db DatabaseConnection) submit_create(input_domain string, pubkey []u8)  {
	key_str := pubkey.str()
	println("[Database] Creating http reference for $input_domain")
	ref := Http_Reference{
		domain: input_domain
		key: key_str
	}
	sql db.connection {
		insert ref into Http_Reference
	}
	
}

fn (db DatabaseConnection) submit_update(input_domain string, pubkey []u8)  {
	cur_time := time.utc()
	key_str := pubkey.str()

	println("[Database] Updating http reference for $input_domain")
	sql db.connection {
		update Http_Reference set key = key_str, last_connected = cur_time where domain == input_domain
	}
}

pub fn (db DatabaseConnection) get_refs() []Http_Reference {
	http_refs := sql db.connection {
		select from Http_Reference
	}

	return http_refs
}
```
