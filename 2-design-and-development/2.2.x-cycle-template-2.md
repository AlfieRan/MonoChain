# 2.2.13 Cycle 13 - Introducing a sql database

## Design

New required packages:

* Docker
* Postgres
* libpq

### Objectives

Now that you can send messages between nodes, it's time to introduce a way of storing these messages and the best way in which I can think of that to be done is by creating a local database such that the node can store and load data onto that database and use it as it's memory. The benefit of introducing a database for this reason also means that the references that were introduced in [Cycle 11 - Remembering Nodes](needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md) can be moved to the database for faster and better storage.

* [ ] Generate a postgreSQL docker container and connect to it upon startup
* [ ] Build the postgreSQL table with required fields.
* [ ] Refactor references to use the database rather than the json file used at the moment.
* [ ] &#x20;Save messages to the database and only forward them through the network if the node hasn't seen it before.

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 2

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
