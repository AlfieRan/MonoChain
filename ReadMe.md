### Alfie Ranstead's A Level Project - A Proof of Trust Blockchain

---

# **The MonoChain**

This is a completely custom built blockchain centered around the proof of trust consensus protocol, a protocol that aims to keep low entry requirements for new nodes whilst retaining a better evironmental footprint than proof of work.

# This Project is Still in Early Development
// TODO - change
It's important to note that this project is still in early development, and as such, is not read for production use.
This means that it cannot currently be used for storing or transferring value, and is not secure enough to be used for anything other than testing.


However, if you would like to contribute to the project, or just want to see how it works, you can read through the source code or visit the [MonoChain website](https://monochain.network) to see the progress of the project.

One of the best ways to keep up to date with this project is to "star" this repo on [GitHub here](https://github.com/AlfieRan/MonoChain).
