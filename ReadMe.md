### Alfie Ranstead's A Level Project - A Proof of Trust Blockchain

---

# **The MonoChain**

This is a completely custom built blockchain centered around the proof of trust consensus protocol, a protocol that aims to keep low entry requirements for new nodes whilst retaining a better evironmental footprint than proof of work.
