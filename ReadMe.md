### Alfie Ranstead's A Level Project - A JSON Oriented Blockchain

#

## **The MonoChain**

This is a completely custom built blockchain centered around the proof of trust consensus protocol, a protocol that aims to keep low entry requirements for new nodes whilst retaining a better evironmental footprint than proof of work.

#

This git repo uses a monorepo in order to keep the various sections of the project in one repository, to view individual parts of the project, visit the "/packages" folder.

The main parts of the project are as follows:

-   Documentation - the documentation for the whole project - stored in `/docs/` as a submodule from the docs fork on the clone of this repo managed by my College. The docs are also viewable on the site https://marling-school.gitbook.io/alfie-ranstead-1/ using gitbook.
-   Node - The code that runs on a computer intending to use it's storage or cpu power alongside it's network connection in order to support the blockchain and recieve a percentage of transactions that flow through it in return for payment. Can be seen in `/packages/node/`
-   Webportal - An example website that allows Users of the blockchain to see the data they own on the blockchain and send transactions to other Users on the blockchain. Stored in `/packages/webportal`

It's also important to note that this repository exists in two places:

-   Within My Sixth Form's project organisation - https://github.com/Marling-CS-Projects/AlfieRanstead-alevel-project/tree/master
-   And on my personal github account - https://github.com/AlfieRan/A-Level-Project
