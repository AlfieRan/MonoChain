# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my success criteria, I had 4 criteria which were related to the function and robustness of the project, three of which were in relation to the node software and one the webportal (website). Since development of the project has now halted, it is time to see how the project fits or doesn't fit into these criteria.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14        | The node software should not crash.                                                                                                     |
| 15        | The software should be capable of receiving multiple messages per second.                                                               |
| 16        | The software should attempt to retry any failed processes (such as loading a file) and should only exit after multiple failed attempts. |
| 24        | The web portal should run without crashing under any circumstance                                                                       |
