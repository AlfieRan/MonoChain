# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my success criteria, I had 4 criteria which were related to the function and robustness of the project, three of which were in relation to the node software and one the webportal (website). Since development of the project has now halted, it is time to see how the project fits or doesn't fit into these criteria.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14        | The node software should not crash.                                                                                                     |
| 15        | The software should be capable of receiving multiple messages per second.                                                               |
| 16        | The software should attempt to retry any failed processes (such as loading a file) and should only exit after multiple failed attempts. |
| 24        | The web portal should run without crashing under any circumstance                                                                       |

### Criterion 14

Although the software does not crash in most circumstances, under a large load it will still crash and since part of the testing involved putting the software under considerable load for a long period of time and it routinely crashed, this criterion has sadly not been met.

This is due to the software running directly on the cpu it is operating on and VLang not having an overhead, therefore if the software crashes it cannot be recovered so although most errors are handled internally through my code, some errors are outside of the scope of the program and cannot be saved once they occur. This effectively means that the only way to stop the program crashing with these kind of errors would be to prevent them from happening, instead of the traditional method to "wrap" the parts of the program that have these crashes with a error handling function since that doesn't exist in VLang.

More evidence for these crashes being a combined cause of both my code and VLang itself is how it behaves differently depending on the operating system it runs on. When using macOS the software requires a pretty significant load of multiple messages per second for 10-20 seconds, generating processes with \~4 threads running at any given time (although these are "green" threads that are based upon software and don't run in a separate hardware thread each). However, when using Linux the software crashes every time that it tries to send a web-socket message which shows that VLang is not as consistent as it would ideally be. Obviously some variations would be expected and, once again, optimising/refactoring my code and how it handles multiple threads would likely increase the stability of the software, but the fact that the exact same code compiled natively on different systems can run so fundamentally differently, without any form of compiler errors or warnings goes to show how VLang still has a long way to mature. Evidence for these claims can be found in the video below.

### Criterion 15

"The software should be capable of receiving multiple messages per second."

Works for like 10 seconds and then breaks on macos + windows

Doesn't work on linux

### Criterion 16

"The software should attempt to retry any failed processes (such as loading a file) and should only exit after multiple failed attempts."

Does this pretty well&#x20;

### Criterion 24

"The web portal should run without crashing under any circumstance"

does this :+1:
