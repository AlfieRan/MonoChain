# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To assess the usability of the project, I have put together a survey to get information on the user's experience whilst using the project. This survey is being used to assess the 5 key points:

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | <p>Do you understand the idea of the project? </p><p>Do you understand the different parts of the project? </p><p>Do you know how to setup the node software? </p><p>Did you know how to use the website?</p> |
| 2 - Efficient      | <p>Is the website quick and easy to navigate through? </p><p>Does the configuration file contain all needed settings?</p>                                                                                     |
| 3 - Engaging       | <p>Did you like using the project? </p><p>Did you like the style of the website? </p><p>Was the messaging demo engaging?</p>                                                                                  |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | <p>Did any parts of the project crash? </p><p>Have you found any errors/bugs in the node software? </p><p>If so, what are they?</p>                                                                           |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | <p>Did you know how to use the messaging demo without any help? </p><p>Did you know how to setup a node? </p><p>Did you know how to use tokens to get access to the dashboard?</p>                            |

Listed below are the results to the questions and why these questions were important, then what the responses to these questions actually means.

## User Feedback

{% tab title="Effective" %}
### Do you understand the idea of the project?&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This aim of this question was to ensure that the website/webportal explained the project quickly and easily enough that the users that looked at it understood the idea of project without any further explanation. As shown it appears that most users (80%) understood the point of the project in some reasonable amount, however, none of the users seemed to understand the project in great detail and one user responded with a disagreement to say that they did not understand the project. This means that the idea of the project was conveyed to some positive extent using the webportal but was not clear enough and needs some more work.



### Do you understand the different parts of the project?&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Following on from the previous question, this shows that although 80% of the users understand the idea of the project on the whole, once asked about if they understand all the different parts of the project, that number drops significantly. This shows that the separate sections of the project are not explained in enough detail and this needs to expanded so that all users understand the very basic information about all parts of the project and understand which parts are aimed at them and which aren't.



### Do you know how to setup the node software?&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was important because the node software is the more technical side of the project (as shown in the [design frame](../2-design-and-development/2.1-design-frame.md)) and hence it is important that technical users understand how to setup and use the node software where as non-technical users do not need to know how to do this. Having said that, the lower the entry requirements to all parts of the project, the better, hence it is still better to have as many users as possible understand how to setup and use a node. As shown in the data 40% of the users agreed to knowing how to setup the node software, with 40% being "neutral" which likely means they figured it out but with the help of other users or myself, then the final 20% of users disagreeing - showing that they didn't know how to do it. This roughly equates to the estimation of half of the users being more technical and half being more casual.

Interestingly the results for this question are also identical to that of the previous question, showing the suggestion of a correlation between users that understand that separate sections of the project and those that understand how to setup and use the node software.



### Did you know how to use the website

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question shows that all of the users either agreed or strongly agreed that they knew how to use the website. This is very important since this part of the project is the key part that all of the users needed to know how to use and understand since it acts as the entry point to every other part of the project. Hence this strong of a response shows that the website was very effective and easy to use and as such was successful in it's goal to be a effective entry point to the project.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:
