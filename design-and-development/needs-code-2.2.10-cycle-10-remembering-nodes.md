# \[needs code] 2.2.11 Cycle 11 - Remembering Nodes

* Start storing node data after they've been collected from nodes
* Create an "online" file which stores nodes that have been online in the past 30 minutes
* create a function to go through the stored nodes and ping them to check who's online, if they respond add them to the online file and if not don't.
* Run this function on startup

## Design

### Pseudocode

Objective 1 solution:

```
```

Objective 2 solution:

```
```

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```
code
```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests
