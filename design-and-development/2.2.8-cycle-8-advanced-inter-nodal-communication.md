# 2.2.7 Cycle 8 - Advanced Inter-Nodal Communication

## Design

### Objectives

The objective for this cycle is to turn the basic inter-nodal communication from Cycle 5 into something more advanced, allowing Nodes to start remembering their neighbours, track their neighbouring node's wallet references and let other nodes know they exist using the ping/pong functionality setup in Cycle 5.

* [ ] Nodes store references to other Nodes.
* [ ] Nodes remember which wallet was running on each Node it has a reference to.
* [ ] Nodes can let other Nodes know that they exist using the ping/pong functionality setup in Cycle 5.

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome
