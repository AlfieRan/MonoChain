# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

* Implemented configuration handler
* Fixed issues with inputs
* Added compiling for Windows
* Tried to add compiling for Linux, too many issues
* Didn't fix issues with compiling for Linux, but users can clone the repo and compile it themselves.

## Design

### Objectives

For this cycle the main objective is to turn the node software into something more aligned with what a user would actually be able to use, as although it will mainly be computer oriented people using this part of the project having it easy to understand is still a big benefit.

* [ ] Implement a configuration handler and setup tool.
* [ ] Add compilation for other operating systems apart from macOS

### Usability Features

#### Configuration handler&#x20;

For the configuration handler it will originally start of very simply and will probably be somewhat a pain to use, but the hope is that by laying out a ground framework now that contains the console interface that will be used to interact with the configuration handler to be in plain, easy to understand English. This will give users the best chance at being able to run through the configuration setup with as little friction as possible.

* Plain, easy to read English text based interface.
* Allows user to respond in a variety of ways (yes: "yes", "y","confirm","approve", etc).

#### Multi-OS compilation

For the compilation, although I would like to make it so that the user just selects which OS they are using on the website and download only the correct version, that would take up too much time at this point of the project and can be added later on, therefore for now the user will just download all available versions of the program and run the one that their system can handler.

* Make it clear which version of the program the user should run based on their system using a brief summary.
* Not crash the computer if the user runs the wrong version.

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```

Objective 2

```

### Challenges

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
