# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

* Implemented configuration handler
* Fixed issues with inputs
* Added compiling for Windows
* Tried to add compiling for Linux, too many issues
* Didn't fix issues with compiling for Linux, but users can clone the repo and compile it themselves.

## Design

### Objectives

For this cycle the main objective is to turn the node software into something more aligned with what a user would actually be able to use, as although it will mainly be computer oriented people using this part of the project having it easy to understand is still a big benefit.

* [ ] Implement a configuration handler and setup tool.
* [ ] Add compilation for other operating systems apart from macOS

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```
code
```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
