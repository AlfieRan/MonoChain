# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Basics (remove once filled out):

* Conceptualised voting and how system rules are going to work.
  * Allows block defined rules to be changed diplomatically and removes control from any individual.
* Transaction speed (cause of planning out voting in more detail)
  * This is needed so as to promote fast block development without creating blocks with very few transactions, this way is the best of both worlds, it promotes somewhere in between.
* Node stuff:
  * Massive error: "SIGSEGV"
    * This is a massive downside of the V language and makes the program very difficult to debug.
    * Very difficult to debug as there is no line number for this kind of error, the error just exists somewhere in the code and it may not even be the code, it could be the compiler.
  *   Switched keys to separate module.

      * This allows signing data to be a public function, whilst the keys remain private so as not to be accessible by other functions.
      * It also allows any module that requires data to be signed to just load the keys and sign it.
      * Downside - May result in the keys file being loaded to memory multiple times and very regularly, may be solved through v's garbage collection but I'm not entirely sure.&#x20;

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```
code
```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
