# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 - Basic Inter-Nodal Communication

* Implemented ping/pong architecture
* Attach these keys and signing to the ping/pong method to verify node's identity

## Design

### Objectives

Now that a lot of the structure of the project has been built up and I have a bit more of an idea where I want to head with the design of the software it's time to start actually putting together the actual networking side of the blockchain. This is arguably the most important part as it was what  allows the blockchain to function properly and securely.

Therefore for this cycle the objectives are to setup some kind of basic communication between nodes, which I will be doing through the use of a&#x20;

* [ ] Objective 1
* [ ] Objective 2
* [ ] Objective 3

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```

```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
