# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

If I want to let users contribute using the node software and continue down the javascript & node.js route they will have to download the software, download node, then all of the libraries I used for the project, which is far from ideal.

Therefore I'm going to be switching to a different programming language and a different distribution method. The conditions I need this programming language to meet are the following:

* Can be compiled with libraries to limit the amount of setup end users have to do.
* Can be compiled to arm and x86 on macOS, Linux and Windows.
* Ideally has type safety
* Runs Fast
* Has networking capabilities
* Has modern features

The best language I could find for those specifications was V [(aka Vlang)](https://vlang.io/) which is a type based language based upon C.

There are both upsides and downsides to using Vlang instead of typescript, the largest upsides are how much faster than typescript it is and that it can be compiled to binary so that end users won't have to worry about downloading additional packages/files. The downsides come more in the form of general development, because Vlang is such a new programming language&#x20;

#### Rewriting what I've done so far.

Now that I've decided to switch from typescript to Vlang I will first need to rewrite everything I've done in this new language. However since this isn't actually that much, I will also be setting up the api server in this cycle which will allow you to go to the ip address that the node is running on and http get it to receive the message "Hello world".

#### Summary of the objectives for this cycle

* [ ] Create a V program that runs.
* [ ] Compile the V program to a macOS executable
* [ ] Configure the build files to compile the V program and put it in the public folder within the web server project so it can be downloaded.
* [ ] Setup the api using the default Vlang library: Vweb
* [ ] Allow the index to be requested using http and respond with "Hello World"

## Development

### Setting up Vlang

Setting up the V compiler is actually pretty basic, all that is needed is to clone the git repo ([https://github.com/vlang/v](https://github.com/vlang/v)), run the make file and then follow the instructions given. I then also setup the symlink, which is what allows the compiler to run just by typing "v" in the terminal rather than having to run the path to the executable.

This can be verified to have being setup properly using "v --version" in the terminal, see tests.
