# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

If I want to let users contribute using the node software and continue down the javascript & node.js route they will have to download the software, download node, then all of the libraries I used for the project, which is far from ideal.

Therefore I'm going to be switching to a different programming language and a different distribution method. The conditions I need this programming language to meet are the following:

* Can be compiled with libraries to limit the amount of setup end users have to do.
* Can be compiled to arm and x86 on macOS, Linux and Windows.
* Ideally has type safety
* Runs Fast
* Has networking capabilities
* Has modern features

The best language I could find for those specifications was V [(aka Vlang)](https://vlang.io/) which is a type based language based upon C.
