# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Node Refactor

## Basics (remove once filled out):

* Node stuff:
  *   Switched keys to separate module.

      * This allows signing data to be a public function, whilst the keys remain private so as not to be accessible by other functions.
      * It also allows any module that requires data to be signed to just load the keys and sign it.
      * Downside - May result in the keys file being loaded to memory multiple times and very regularly, may be solved through v's garbage collection but I'm not entirely sure.&#x20;
      * Development issues:
        * Generated a small error regarding files not being openable, this is because I switched to using `./monochain/file` instead of just using `./file`
          * Error due to vlang's file writer not being able to open files in directories that don't exist yet, so the directories must be created first during the file opening cycle.
        * Massive error: "SIGSEGV"
          * This is a massive downside of the V language and makes the program very difficult to debug.
          * Very difficult to debug as there is no line number for this kind of error, the error just exists somewhere in the code and it may not even be the code, it could be the compiler.
          * Issue was due to a type declaration loop.
            * In cryptography/main.v the struct Keys was defined as Keys {KeysType} and the type KeysType was defined as Keys



## Design

### Objectives

After beginning to plan out the slightly more advanced inter nodal communication [(which should be in a later cycle not too much later than this one)](needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md) I have come to the realisation that housing the cryptography and configuration module in the same place is probably not a good idea.&#x20;

This is because after a few experiments I realised that without editing and recompiling it, the V-Web module that I'm using to host the api routes for the nodes prevents the loading of custom non-public variables into the web object to be used within those routes. What that means in English is that I can't setup the node's cryptography keys to be passed to the node whenever it receives a new api request and hence need to find a work around.

There are two main options here:

1. Reload the configuration object every time the program needs the cryptography keys to do anything.
2. Store the keys as a separate object and just reload them when they're needed.

Therefore in this cycle, one of these options needs to be selected, and then executed.

* [ ] Choose a method of loading the cryptography data
* [ ] Implement that method
* [ ] Refactor any sections of code that need to be updated
* [ ] Fix any newly generated errors and get back to at least what was working before this refactor

### Usability Features

* Feature 1
* Feature 2

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

Objective 1 solution:

Objective 2 solution:

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```

```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
