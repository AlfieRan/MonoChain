# \[needs code] 2.2.11 Cycle 11 - Expanding Node Networks Through Neighbours

* Allow nodes to request lists of online nodes from each other so as to grow their networks.
* This is fundamental to allowing nodes to grow their networks and hence keep the network alive

## Design

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```
code
```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives
