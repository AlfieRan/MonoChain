# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

* Fixed issues with inputs
* Added compiling for Windows
* Tried to add compiling for Linux, too many issues
* Didn't fix issues with compiling for Linux, but users can clone the repo and compile it themselves.

## Design

### Objectives

The main objective in this cycle is to allow the software to be compiled and ran on multiple operating systems, apart from just macOS. The key OS here is windows, but I will also be trying to get compilation working for Linux.

* [ ] Compile for Windows
* [ ] Test the current software on Windows and ensure it works properly
* [ ] Compile for Linux
* [ ] Test the software on Linux and ensure it works properly

### Usability Features

For the compilation, I would like to make it so that the user just selects which OS they are using on the website and download only the correct version, however that would take up too much time at this point of the project and can be added later on, therefore for now the user will just download all available versions of the program and run the one that their system can handle.

* Make it clear which version of the program the user should run based on their system using a brief summary.
* Not crash the computer if the user runs the wrong version.

### Pseudocode

## Development

Most of the development for this cycle was just setup, to get everything I need for this project up and running and building out the structure of the codebase in order to make the actual programming as smooth as possible.

### Outcome

Objective 1

```
code
```

Objective 2

```
code
```

### Challenges

Challenges faced in either/both objectives

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       |           |
| 2    |              |               |                       |           |
| 3    |              |               |                       |           |
