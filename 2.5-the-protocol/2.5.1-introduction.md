# 2.5.1 Introduction

This is where the rules and methods of the MonoChain Blockchain are explained and conceptualised, this section was developed primarily during development but was also initially planned out in analysis as it is obviously the backbone of this project. Due to this it does not directly tie into the development of the code and the same sections of protocol are referenced at varying points during the main development cycle.

Hence each page (topic) contains a footer titled "Timeline" which helps to give more context to how and when each part of the protocol was developed alongside being mentioned in the regarded cycles.
