# 2.5.3 Consensus Algorithm

The documents within this section are primarily for the unique parts of this blockchain when referring to the consensus algorithm, or how Nodes (servers that contribute to the blockchain) decide whether or not to trust each other.

The Consensus Algorithm (or Protocol) for this project has been given the name 'Proof of Worth' due to being based upon Nodes proving their worth to each other in exchange for more trust and autonomy and can be read about below:

Another important part of this blockchain which is fairly unique is the built in support for the voting of changes to the variables which determine how the blockchain works, although this is a fairly high scope part of the project so may not remain in a theoretical state at the point at which this project is handed in to be marked.
