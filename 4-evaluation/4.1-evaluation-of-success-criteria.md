| 2         | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. |                      |
| 3         | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.          |                      |

### Network Communication

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                             | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 4         | Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.                                                |                      |
| 5         | Node should have web-socket connection abilities for server or client connections.                                                                                                      |                      |
| 6         | Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally.                                                                          |                      |
| 7         | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. |                      |
| 8         | Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.                                                                                                                  |                      |
| 9         | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains.                                                                        |                      |

| 11        | The configuration handler should be usable and accessible to technical users with non-technical users being able to use it with additional help. |   |
| 12        | Nodes should have some kind of web based access dashboard.                                                                                       |   |
