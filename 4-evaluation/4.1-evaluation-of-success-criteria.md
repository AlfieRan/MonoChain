# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Node Software & Protocol

### Individual blocks

| Criterion | Description                                                              | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1         | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | Not met.             |
| 2         | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | Not met.             |
| 3         | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.          | Not met.             |

Purely in terms of the actual software aspect none of these three criterion were met since I did not reach the stage in development of the project which would allow for the addition and translation of protocol rules into the actual software networking to allow the blockchain to run and send theorised data through it, however in the protocol form this criterions where all laid out as discussed in each individual one.

#### Criterion 1

{% hint style="danger" %}
Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was not implemented in software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above. However in terms of the protocol, the framework for how this would work and hence would be implemented into the node software can be found in the [initial project analysis here](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution/1.4.1-the-protocol/#chaining-blocks).

#### Criterion 2 and 3

{% hint style="danger" %}
2\. Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software.\
3\. Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.
{% endhint %}

Both of these Cycles relate to the same thing: validating blocks and acting accordingly; with criterion 2 being in relation to disregarding invalid blocks and cycle 3 approving valid blocks.

Sadly neither of these criterion were implemented in the node software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above.&#x20;

Although this was not implemented on the scale of blocks, this criterion was partially met in the fashion of the node software detecting and disregarding transactions and messages that were invalid. This was first implemented in [cycle 10 ](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md#only-signing-date-time-objects)where it was made that the software should only sign specific types of data that it receieved and was then expanded in more detail throughout cycles [12](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-12) and [14](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.11-cycle-11-expanding-node-networks-through-neighbours.md).

```v
// V code - within the "pong" route in /src/modules/server/main.v 

// with this version of the node software all messages should be time objects
time := time.parse(req_parsed.message) or {
    eprintln("Incorrect time format supplied to /pong/:req by node claiming to be $req_parsed.ping_key")
    return app.server_error(403)
}

// time was okay, so store a slight positive grudge
println("Time parsed correctly as: $time")
```

Therefore it can be seen that there is evidence that this criterion would've been met if the project's development continued over a longer time span.

### Network Communication

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                             | When was it achieved                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4         | Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.                                                | First developed in [Cycle 1](../2-design-and-development/2.2.1-cycle-1-the-framework.md), met in [Cycle 12](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template.md).              |

| 6         | Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally.                                                                          | Met in [Cycle 11](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md), improved in [Cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md). |
| 7         | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. | Not met.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8         | Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.                                                                                                                  | Met in [Cycle 12](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template.md).                                                                                                        |
| 9         | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains.                                                                        | Met in [Cycle 11](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md), improved in [Cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md). |

#### Criterion 4

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The above image shows the home route of the http api server running on the node software, since there are quite a few api routes the rest are shown below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These routes not only allow for the http server to be used for communication between nodes but also allow for the user to interact and send messages over the network. This can be seen through the categorisation supplied with the 'User Pages' being used to show the user some data or allow them to interact with their node through a nicer ui than having to use the terminal window; the 'Internal Api' is then used to ensure the person accessing the node does actually have control of the node and let them send messages using the web interface; and finally the 'External Api' are the routes that will be called by other nodes looking to interact with or send a message to the receipient node.

#### Criterion 5

{% hint style="warning" %}
Node should have web-socket connection abilities for server or client connections.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was partially met in [cycle 14](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.11-cycle-11-expanding-node-networks-through-neighbours.md) where websockets were implemented using VLang's net.websockets module and the functionality tested well initially but had some serious issues upon continued use.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Messages being received and then crashing from Cycle 14</p></figcaption></figure>

The above screenshot shows a message being successfully received and then the software crashing after attempting to forward it onto the other nodes it was aware of. This occurred approximately 20 messages into a test where a message was sent every 0.5 seconds as such showing that the websockets partially work but cannot handle continuted use very well.

Sadly this is primarily an issue with VLang and although improved code on my half would most likely expand the length of time that the software runs for before crashing there is a high probability that these sorts of issues would continue to happen. This is because the panic shown above and similar errors that were encountered occoured upon the websocket module calling other vlang standard library modules through my middleware meaning that the issues were within the modules supplied to the vlang standard library which I cannot easily fix.

#### Criterion 6

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally.
{% endhint %}

In order to prove that this functionality works quickly and easily after changes I built the following automatic testing functions:

```v
// This tests the creation of a node reference
fn test_create_ref() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)
	database.stop()
	// this test will crash if it fails
	assert true
}

// This tests to check if the node will correctly state if it is aware of a node
fn test_aware_ref() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)
	aware := db.aware_of('test')
	database.stop()
	assert aware
}

// This tests to see if the node will collect all of it's references properly
fn test_refs() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)	// create a ref if the test one doesn't already exist
	refs := db.get_refs()
	database.stop()
	assert refs.len > 0
}

// This is used to generate a testing reference object when needed
fn create_test_ref(db database.DatabaseConnection) {
	mut aware := db.aware_of('test')

	if !aware {
		// just in case the test ref doesn't exist
		db.create_ref('test', 'test'.bytes())
		aware = db.aware_of('test')
	}
}
```

These functions are part of the larger 'database\_test.v' file which I designed in [cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md) but are the only tests necessary to prove this criterion has been met. Upon running these tests the following is output to the terminal by VLang's built in testing functionality.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The first two tests passing</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The final test passing.</p></figcaption></figure>

As shown above, not only did the three tests discussed pass, but so did the other 5 in this testing module, hence proving that this criterion is met.
