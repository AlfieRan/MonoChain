# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Node Software & Protocol

### Individual blocks

| Criterion | Description                                                              | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1         | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | Not met.             |
| 2         | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | Not met.             |
| 3         | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.          | Not met.             |

Purely in terms of the actual software aspect none of these three criterion were met since I did not reach the stage in development of the project which would allow for the addition and translation of protocol rules into the actual software networking to allow the blockchain to run and send theorised data through it, however in the protocol form this criterions where all laid out as discussed in each individual one.

#### Criterion 1

{% hint style="danger" %}
Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was not implemented in software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above. However in terms of the protocol, the framework for how this would work and hence would be implemented into the node software can be found in the [initial project analysis here](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution/1.4.1-the-protocol/#chaining-blocks).

#### Criterion 2 and 3

{% hint style="danger" %}
2\. Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software.\
3\. Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.
{% endhint %}

Both of these Cycles relate to the same thing: validating blocks and acting accordingly; with criterion 2 being in relation to disregarding invalid blocks and cycle 3 approving valid blocks.

Sadly neither of these criterion were implemented in the node software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above.&#x20;

Although this was not implemented on the scale of blocks, this criterion was partially met in the fashion of the node software detecting and disregarding transactions and messages that were invalid. This was first implemented in [cycle 10 ](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md#only-signing-date-time-objects)where it was made that the software should only sign specific types of data that it receieved and was then expanded in more detail throughout cycles [12](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-12) and [14](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.11-cycle-11-expanding-node-networks-through-neighbours.md).

```v
// V code - within the "pong" route in /src/modules/server/main.v 

// with this version of the node software all messages should be time objects
time := time.parse(req_parsed.message) or {
    eprintln("Incorrect time format supplied to /pong/:req by node claiming to be $req_parsed.ping_key")
    return app.server_error(403)
}

// time was okay, so store a slight positive grudge
println("Time parsed correctly as: $time")
```

Therefore it can be seen that there is evidence that this criterion would've been met if the project's development continued over a longer time span.

### Network Communication

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                             | When was it achieved                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4         | Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.                                                | First developed in [Cycle 1](../2-design-and-development/2.2.1-cycle-1-the-framework.md), met in [Cycle 12](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template.md).              |

| 6         | Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally.                                                                          | Met in [Cycle 11](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md), improved in [Cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md). |
| 7         | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. | Not met.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8         | Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.                                                                                                                  | Met in [Cycle 12](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template.md).                                                                                                        |
| 9         | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains.                                                                        | Met in [Cycle 11](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md), improved in [Cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md). |

#### Criterion 4

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should have an open api server running using http that contains enough pathways to complete all the needed types of communication.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The above image shows the home route of the http api server running on the node software, since there are quite a few api routes the rest are shown below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These routes not only allow for the http server to be used for communication between nodes but also allow for the user to interact and send messages over the network. This can be seen through the categorisation supplied with the 'User Pages' being used to show the user some data or allow them to interact with their node through a nicer ui than having to use the terminal window; the 'Internal Api' is then used to ensure the person accessing the node does actually have control of the node and let them send messages using the web interface; and finally the 'External Api' are the routes that will be called by other nodes looking to interact with or send a message to the receipient node.

#### Criterion 5

{% hint style="warning" %}
Node should have web-socket connection abilities for server or client connections.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was partially met in [cycle 14](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.11-cycle-11-expanding-node-networks-through-neighbours.md) where websockets were implemented using VLang's net.websockets module and the functionality tested well initially but had some serious issues upon continued use.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Messages being received and then crashing from Cycle 14</p></figcaption></figure>

The above screenshot shows a message being successfully received and then the software crashing after attempting to forward it onto the other nodes it was aware of. This occurred approximately 20 messages into a test where a message was sent every 0.5 seconds as such showing that the websockets partially work but cannot handle continuted use very well.

Sadly this is primarily an issue with VLang and although improved code on my half would most likely expand the length of time that the software runs for before crashing there is a high probability that these sorts of issues would continue to happen. This is because the panic shown above and similar errors that were encountered occoured upon the websocket module calling other vlang standard library modules through my middleware meaning that the issues were within the modules supplied to the vlang standard library which I cannot easily fix.

#### Criterion 6

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should be able to add and remove each other to their communication lists which should be stored locally.
{% endhint %}

In order to prove that this functionality works quickly and easily after changes I built the following automatic testing functions:

```v
// This tests the creation of a node reference
fn test_create_ref() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)
	database.stop()
	// this test will crash if it fails
	assert true
}

// This tests to check if the node will correctly state if it is aware of a node
fn test_aware_ref() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)
	aware := db.aware_of('test')
	database.stop()
	assert aware
}

// This tests to see if the node will collect all of it's references properly
fn test_refs() {
	database.launch()
	db := database.connect(false, pg.Config{})
	create_test_ref(db)	// create a ref if the test one doesn't already exist
	refs := db.get_refs()
	database.stop()
	assert refs.len > 0
}

// This is used to generate a testing reference object when needed
fn create_test_ref(db database.DatabaseConnection) {
	mut aware := db.aware_of('test')

	if !aware {
		// just in case the test ref doesn't exist
		db.create_ref('test', 'test'.bytes())
		aware = db.aware_of('test')
	}
}
```

These functions are part of the larger 'database\_test.v' file which I designed in [cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md) but are the only tests necessary to prove this criterion has been met. Upon running these tests the following is output to the terminal by VLang's built in testing functionality.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The first two tests passing</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The final test passing.</p></figcaption></figure>

As shown above, not only did the three tests discussed pass, but so did the other 5 in this testing module, hence proving that this criterion is met.

#### Criterion 7

{% hint style="danger" %}
Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block.
{% endhint %}

Although I did begin work on this criterion while [introducing the sql database in cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md), I quickly realised that there would be no way of actually using grudges until block creation was introduced later on in the project so removed it to be reintroduced later. Sadly however this later point was never reached so this criterion has not been met, and it should be introduced shortly after block creation has been implemented and criterion 1,2 and 3 have been met.

#### Criterion 8

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should send through a digital signature with each communication.
{% endhint %}

As of [cycle 12](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template.md), all messages and methods of communication sent between nodes contains a signature except for some specific exceptions in which it is not required such as when one node request the initiation of a handshake from another node, since the signatures are then sent within the handshake. Therefore this criterion is currently met, although it would need to be continued to be met throughout future development and the introduciton of more communication methods and usecases between nodes.

#### Criterion 9

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains.
{% endhint %}

As of [cycle 10](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md) all messages between nodes contain the sending node's ip address or dns domain (acts the same as an ip address in all forms of communication used within the project) and whenever a node encounters a message from a node that it does not recognise the ip address/domain of it will send it a handshake request in order to check it's validity and then assuming it is a valid monochain node will store the data it learns about that node locally.

Initially this data was stored in JSON files but since I realised this could get slow and complicated quickly in cycle 13 this was improved to be done through a postgreSQL sql database which the node software queries and talks to as often is required. By default this database will be automatically setup and controlled by the node software through the use of a docker container but it can be hosted manually by the user if they wished to have more control over the database, for example to give multiple nodes access to the same database.

| 13        | The node dashboard should be easily accessible and usable by all forms of users.                                                                 | Partially met in [Usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-13). |

#### Criterion 10

{% hint style="success" %}
A configuration handler.
{% endhint %}

The configuration handler for the node software was originally introduced in cycle 3 but it has been continued to be improved, had more settings added and restructured for easier use throughout many various points of the project and should be continue into the future as development proceeds.

This handler controls the generation of new configurations, alongside the loading, saving and use of those configuration settings as is needed by other parts of the project.

#### Criterion 11

{% hint style="success" %}
The configuration handler should be usable and accessible to technical users with non-technical users being able to use it with additional help.
{% endhint %}

In [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-11), three of the questions in the user survey were examined to show that all users had atleast heard of the configuration file existing, with the majority knowing what it could be used for and some of the more technical users within that pool knowing how to use it without additional help but the majority of users requiring assistance.

This meets the criterion since the majority of users are non-technical users and those users who did not require assistance were the technical users, however in the future this could still be improved by including some basic documentation to assist users and hopefully allow more users to be able to use the configuration handler.

#### Criterion 12

{% hint style="success" %}
Nodes should have some kind of web based access dashboard.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was first met in cycle 12 and uses a simple token based system to ensure that users who gain access to the dashboard are in fact in control of the node which hence meets the criterion.

Although this could be improved by adding more functionality to the dashboard to give users more of a reason to use it alongside making the way in which users both login to and the dashboard itself look nicer and contain more context to explain how to login and use it so as to make the dashboard simpler to use as some users did not understand how to login without assistance.

#### Criterion 13

{% hint style="warning" %}
The node dashboard should be easily accessible and usable by all forms of users.
{% endhint %}

This criterion was proven to be partially met in [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-13) as the majority of users seemed to know how to access the dashboard but due to the mis-communication during testing some users did not realise they were navigating to and using the dashboard which would probably increase the number of users who stated they were able to navigated and use it.

I suggest this as I discovered more users said they knew how to access the dashboard than the amount who said they knew what it was and after the survey I talked to all the users who did not agree to either question relating to this topic in the survey they all seemed to realise what it was after a very very brief explanation, hence suggesting some form of basic documentation or tutorial explaining the essentials to them could bring this up to being met.

Although alongside this I believe that the login page to access the dashboard should be a lot more clear about where to find the token that was generated to login with (it is output within the node's terminal output) as most users who tested this had to search around for a few minutes to find it if they did so without assistance and in reality this should be a very simple task. Hence in the future it would be a good idea to add a basic tutorial/summary on how to login so as to speed this up.
