# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

Node Software / Protocol

### Individual blocks

| Criterion | Description                                                              | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1         | Blocks must refer to the previous block in the chain.                    | Not met.             |
| 2         | Blocks must be detected as invalid and disregarded by the node software. | Not met.             |
| 3         | Blocks must be detected as valid and approved by node software.          | Not met.             |

Purely in terms of the actual software aspect none of these three criterion were met since I did not reach the stage in development of the project which would allow for the addition and translation of protocol rules into the actual software networking to allow the blockchain to run and send theorised data through it, however in the protocol form this criterions where all laid out as discussed in each individual one.

#### Criterion 1

This criterion was not implemented in software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above. However in terms of the protocol, the framework for how this would work and hence would be implemented into the node software can be found in the [initial project analysis here](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-proposed-solution/1.4.1-the-protocol/#chaining-blocks).

#### Criterion 2 and 3

Both of these Cycles relate to the same thing: validating blocks and acting accordingly; with criterion 2 being in relation to disregarding invalid blocks and cycle 3 approving valid blocks.

Sadly neither of these criterion were implemented in the node software due to time constraints as discussed in summary paragraph above.&#x20;

Although this was not implemented on the scale of blocks, this criterion was partially met in the fashion of the node software detecting and disregarding transactions and messages that were invalid. This was first implemented in [cycle 10 ](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.9-cycle-9-basic-inter-nodal-communication.md#only-signing-date-time-objects)where it was made that the software should only sign specific types of data that it receieved and was then expanded in more detail throughout cycles [12](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-12) and [14](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.11-cycle-11-expanding-node-networks-through-neighbours.md).

```v
// V code - within the "pong" route in /src/modules/server/main.v 

// with this version of the node software all messages should be time objects
time := time.parse(req_parsed.message) or {
    eprintln("Incorrect time format supplied to /pong/:req by node claiming to be $req_parsed.ping_key")
    return app.server_error(403)
}

// time was okay, so store a slight positive grudge
println("Time parsed correctly as: $time")
```

Therefore it can be seen that there is evidence that this criterion would've been met if the project's development continued over a longer time span.

### Network Communication

| 7         | Nodes should be able to store a local "grudge" object that just remembers who the node has a good or bad experience with to change their trust level when they create their next block. | Not met.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 9         | Nodes should be able to remember each other through a combination of their wallet address and their ips/domains.                                                                        | Met in [Cycle 11](../2-design-and-development/needs-code-2.2.10-cycle-10-remembering-nodes.md), improved in [Cycle 13](../2-design-and-development/2.2.x-cycle-template-1.md). |
