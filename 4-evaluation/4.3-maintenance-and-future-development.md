* Rewrite node software in a more established language - Rust? C?

* This shows that the separate sections of the project are not explained in enough detail and this needs to expanded so that all users understand the very basic information about all parts of the project and understand which parts are aimed at them and which aren't.
* Fix messaging demo
* Add instructions to messaging demo
* Tune website to work on tablets/phones without any visual glitches (setup a node menu + home page buttons on tablets.)
* Do user testing with a separate standard/technical user focus groups to see the difference and ensure the users can accomplish what their group should be able to do.

## Current Limitations of Project

* Vlang = trash (show evidence, and explain how the node software is affected by it.)
* more than 1 thing. that makes it a list
