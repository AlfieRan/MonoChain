# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

The two most substantial limitations the project faced were the choice of programming langauge for the node software and the time in which I had to complete the development of the project. Although due to the fact that in order to progress much further past the point at which I reached in the development of the node software I would have to completely refactor the software into another language which would take time it can be summarised that the only real limitation is that of time, which sadly is a limitation that all projects have to face, although I will go into how the project could progress if it was given more time and that is what I shall do in the rest of this document.

Straight away we can disect what limitations in the project's current state of development this language limitation has caused:

### Node Software:

* Performance:&#x20;
  * Crashes under continued or heavy use.
  * Limited by the computer/server that the software is ran on.
  * Primarily operates on a singular cpu core rather than all that a computer has to offer.&#x20;
* Platform Support:
  * Must have websockets disabled in order to operate on Linux.
  * Is currently only precompiled for macOS ARM systems meaning that other systems have to spend longer setting up nodes.
  * Will only run on ARM and x86 systems (desktops/laptops) and not mobile devices.
* Usability - Very little documentation or explanations on how to use various parts of the software which raises the entry level of users who can actually use the software.&#x20;

### Web portal:

* Features - Missing various features (wallet access, online market) due to node software not being far enough on in development to allow this to be used.
* Platform Support:
  * Only accessible on a browser with access to the internet.
  * Some parts of the site do not work on mobile or tablet devices.

The majority of these limitations can be assessed and changed in future development to meet the direction in which the project is growing.





## Maintaining the Project

Based upon the project's current state one of two primary strategies can be followed depending on wether the aims for the project remained to complete all that was originally conceputlised and further expansion past that point or to optimise and fix what currently exists of the project so as to use it as some form of decentralised communication system as is done in the messaging demo.

### Optimising it's Current State

#### The Webportal

Describe how should be kept up to date with development of project and improving documentation

#### The Node Software

Dependent on scale, may wish to rewrite in a new language

fixing bugs with the short term bug fixes, handling current user sizes, etc.



### Growing into an Ideal Blockchain

Initially all of the optimisations and fundamental upgrades mentioned in the other strategy can be used so as to bring the project up to a stable level, with the requirement that the node software is rewritten in a different langauge that fully supports all that the project requires so as to ensure that there are no (or minimal) further issues with the node software that are not due to the project itself.





## Future Development&#x20;

### Short Term Bug Fixes

* Tune website to work on tablets/phones without any visual glitches (setup a node menu + home page buttons on tablets.)
* fix the messaging demo so that it works consistently for a small group of nodes.
* Do user testing with a separate standard/technical user focus groups to see the difference and ensure the users can accomplish what their group should be able to do.
* see if possible to fix websockets crashing linux sofware or if that is a V issue
* Optimise message communication so that it is more stable while transmitting more than 1 message per second.
* add a basic tutorial/summary on how to login to node dashboard
* add documentation on how to use node config
* Add instructions on how to do everything
* TThe separate sections of the project are not explained in enough detail and this needs to expanded so that all users understand the very basic information about all parts of the project and understand which parts are aimed at them and which aren't.



### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Rewrite node software in a more established language - Rust? C? Go? Typescript?
* Implement the protocol on top of the communication layer.
