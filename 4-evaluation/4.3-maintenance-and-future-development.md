# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

### Notes (remove after rewrite)

* This shows that the separate sections of the project are not explained in enough detail and this needs to expanded so that all users understand the very basic information about all parts of the project and understand which parts are aimed at them and which aren't.

## Current Limitations of Project

* Vlang = trash (show evidence, and explain how the node software is affected by it.)
* more than 1 thing. that makes it a list

## Maintaining the Project

Describe aspects of maintainability

## Future Development&#x20;

### Short Term Bug Fixes

* Tune website to work on tablets/phones without any visual glitches (setup a node menu + home page buttons on tablets.)
* fix the messaging demo so that it works consistently for a small group of nodes.
* Add instructions on how to do everything
* Do user testing with a separate standard/technical user focus groups to see the difference and ensure the users can accomplish what their group should be able to do.
*

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Rewrite node software in a more established language - Rust? C? Go? Typescript?
* Implement the protocol on top of the communication layer.
