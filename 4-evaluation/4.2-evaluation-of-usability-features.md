The vast majority of users had atleast a basic understanding of the idea of the project.                                                                                              |
| [Do you understand the different parts of the project?](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#do-you-understand-the-different-parts-of-the-project) | 40% Agreed, 40% were Neutral, 20% Disagreed. A large minority of users understood the different projects with the majority being somewhat unsure.                                                                |
| [Do you know how to setup the node software?](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#do-you-know-how-to-setup-the-node-software)                     | 40% Agreed, 40% were Neutral, 20% Disagreed. A large minority of users knew how to setup the node software with the majority of users indicating that they would probably need atleast some level of assistance. |
| [Did you know how to use the website](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#did-you-know-how-to-use-the-website)                                    | 80% Strongly Agree, 20% Agree. All users knew how to use the website at atleast some basic level with the vast majority being confident in how to use it.                                                        |

### Feature 1

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that the user can use the majority of the project without having to get much support and thus the software is intuitive.
{% endhint %}

Based upon the usability testing responses supplied in the above table we can immediately see that the majority of users understood the general idea of the project and how to use the web portal/website but only 40% seemed to understand the node software. This then means that that 40% were likely the same 40% who stated that they understood all the different parts of the project.

This is sufficient evidence to state that this feature was partially met as it was not required that all users can use and understand all of the project but rather the majority of the project and since the vast majority of users understood the fundamental idea of the project and how to use the website/webportal it is clear that the vast majority of users understood the essential parts of the project. However it can also be shown that the vast majority also did not grasp the concepts and understanding of the node software which is a large portion of the project which hence prevents this feature from being a complete success.

### Feature 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make the software as easy to understand as possible such that the user has high autonomy.
{% endhint %}

Similar to feature 1, we can see from the responses given in the above table from usability testing that the vast majority of users knew how to use the website but were less stable on the node software meaning that they would have high autonomy with anything related to that website but not the node software. Therefore this feature is partially met.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Ensure users can get from one point on the website to any other within 3-7 clicks, with 3 being for major sections such as the home page and 7 being the more detailed sections such as the documentation for the configuration file for the Node software. | Success         |
| 2           | Allow users to setup a node and have it start running within as small a time period as possible.                                                                                                                                                            | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

{% hint style="success" %}
Ensure users can get from one point on the website to any other within 3-7 clicks, with 3 being for major sections such as the home page and 7 being the more detailed sections such as the documentation for the configuration file for the Node software.
{% endhint %}

All pages on the webportal can be reached within 2 clicks of the homepage on desktop or 3 clicks on mobile and since it takes a maximum of 1 click to get to the homepage from any other page, any page can be reached from any other page within 3 clicks on desktop and 4 on mobile.

All major sections can be reached in 1 click of the homepage on desktop or 2 on mobile thus meaning that all major sections can be reached within a maximum of 3 clicks on any platform and any page can be reached within 4 clicks on any platform meeting the requirements for this feature.

### Feature 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Allow users to setup a node and have it start running within as small a time period as possible.
{% endhint %}

If the user is on macOS or a precompiled architecture and wishes to setup a worker node, setup and running can be done very quickly. This is becuase the supplied example configuration file needs very little setup and can be done through the terminal control of the node software itself which is built to be fast and simple to use.&#x20;

The software can also be compiled for other operating systems such as Windows and Linux which would allow this to be the case for an even larger pool of users but that would require doing so on a windows/linux computer which I did not have time to do every time I updated the software. Although if the project was being ran by a large enough user pool to warrant doing so it could be done.

The issue here is that if the user wishes to setup a leader node they must carefully configure their configuration file manually and ensure they have set up the correct open ports and networking settings within their local network which can take some time. Or if the user is trying to run the software on a non-precompiled architecture they must download the source code of the project and the Vlang compiler in order to compile and run the software. In either case the node cannot be setup very quickly hence preventing this feature from being completely successful.

### Feature 1

{% hint style="success" %}
Minimise the amount of user input required to operate the Node software.
{% endhint %}

Config is loaded with defualt variables and does not need changing unless the user wishes to become a leader node.

### Feature 2

{% hint style="success" %}
Categorise web-portal transportation methods to simple, easy to understand groupings such that users are not overwhelmed with choice but instead can make a few simple choices to get to where they need to go.
{% endhint %}

Web portal navigation is grouped and does not show more than 4 sections per grouping so as to make navigation as simple as possible.
