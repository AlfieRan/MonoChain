| 1           | Ensure that the user can use the majority of the project without having to get much support and thus the software is intuitive. |              |
| 2           | Make the software as easy to understand as possible such that the user has high autonomy.                                       |              |

### Feature 1

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that the user can use the majority of the project without having to get much support and thus the software is intuitive.
{% endhint %}

The two areas to test for this feature are the "effective" and "easy to learn" sections of the [usability testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md). Specifically the questions that were asked in the user survey that relate to this feature are the following:

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="select">Type</th><th>Question</th><th>Summary of Responses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#do-you-understand-the-idea-of-the-project">Do you understand the idea of the project?</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#do-you-understand-the-different-parts-of-the-project">Do you understand the different parts of the project?</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#do-you-know-how-to-setup-the-node-software">Do you know how to setup the node software?</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#did-you-know-how-to-use-the-website">Did you know how to use the website</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#did-you-know-how-to-use-the-messaging-demo-without-any-help">Did you know how to use the messaging demo without any help?</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#did-you-know-how-to-setup-a-node">Did you know how to setup a node?</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#did-you-know-how-to-use-tokens-to-get-access-to-the-dashboard">Did you know how to use tokens to get access to the dashboard?</a></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 2

| 1           | Ensure users can get from one point on the website to any other within 3-7 clicks, with 3 being for major sections such as the home page and 7 being the more detailed sections such as the documentation for the configuration file for the Node software. | Success         |
| 2           | Allow users to setup a node and have it start running within as small a time period as possible.                                                                                                                                                            | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

{% hint style="success" %}
Ensure users can get from one point on the website to any other within 3-7 clicks, with 3 being for major sections such as the home page and 7 being the more detailed sections such as the documentation for the configuration file for the Node software.
{% endhint %}

All pages on the webportal can be reached within 2 clicks of the homepage on desktop or 3 clicks on mobile and since it takes a maximum of 1 click to get to the homepage from any other page, any page can be reached from any other page within 3 clicks on desktop and 4 on mobile.

### Feature 2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Allow users to setup a node and have it start running within as small a time period as possible.
{% endhint %}

If the user is on macOS or a precompiled architecture, setup and running can be done very quickly but if they are not it takes longer.
